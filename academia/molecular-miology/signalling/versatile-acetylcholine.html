    <h1>Versatile Acetylcholine</h1>
      <p>
        Everyone knows ACh stimulates skeletal muscle to contract. You might also remember that striated muscle (including skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle) contraction is initiated by a wave of depolarisation, followed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> release—troponin—tropomyosin displacement—exposure of myosin head binding site. However, the interaction between ACh and muscle contraction is much more than this.
      </p>
      <p>
        ACh reduces heart rate, causes bronchioles to constrict (bronchoconstriction) and blood vessles to dialate (vasodilation), using 3 different mechanisms (4, if counting skeletal muscle contraction).
      </p>
      <p>So, <i>why</i>?</p>
      <p>
        Neurobiologists classify neurotransmitter receptors into 'ionotropic receptors' and 'metabotropic receptors'. Iootropic receptors are ion channels; ligand (neurotransmitter) binding causes the ion channel to open, allowing passage of specific ions to passively diffuse across the plasma membrane (down their electrochemical gradient). Metabotropic receptors act indirectly on ion channels through intracellualr signalling pathways to produce versatile effects. Most metabotropic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Skeletal muscles have ionotropic ACh receptors. They are also called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which is named after their agonist nicotine. ACh is secreted by the terminal bouton of the lower motor neuron innervating the corresponding muscle fibre into the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). ACh diffuse across the NMJ and bind to ionotropic receptors, thus opening these cation channels. Although these channels have a loose specificity—Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> can all pass through—Na<sup>+</sup> influx predominates, causing depolarisation (this can be explained by electrochemical driving force or the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz (GHK) voltage equation).
      </p>
      <p>
        The ACh receptors responsible for the other effects mentioned above are metabotropic, and they are called muscarinic receptors (also named after their agonist, muscarine). These receptors are all G protein-coupled receptors and are all sensitive to muscarine, but they are classified into 5 types (M<sub>1</sub> to M<sub>5</sub>) according to their functional differences. 
      </p>
      <p>
        How can similar (sometimes identical) receptors with the same extracelluar ligand exert different effects? Apparently it's due to the variation in the indentity and/or the expression level of the proteins involved in downstream signalling pathways. It can be done in several ways. I shall describe them in a separate article and make a hyperlink here. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Cardiac muscle expresses M<sub>2</sub> receptors, which are coupled with the G protein G<sub>i</sub>. This class of G protein has two main effects upon activation: its α subunit <em>inhibits</em> adenylyl cyclase and its βγ subunit opens K<sup>+</sup> channels. It is the increased conductance of K<sup>+</sup> that makes depolarisation of the membrane and subsequent muscle contraction more difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bronchiole smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells express M<sub>3</sub> receptors, which are associated with G<sub>q</sub>. Upon activation, its α subunit activates phospholipase C-β (PLC-β).
