<p>I started this blog to showcase weekly assignments (mainly essays) of mine as a below-average biochemistry student in Oxford. As Iâ€™m moving to Japan, I find myself willing to write on more topics, mainly life- and politics-related. Not much content at the moment, but thank you for your visit. <a href="./cv.pdf">CV is here.</a></p>
