	abstract = {Abstract Mapping of large sets of high-throughput sequencing reads to a reference genome is one of the foundational steps in RNA-seq data analysis. The STAR software package performs this task with high levels of accuracy and speed. In addition to detecting annotated and novel splice junctions, STAR is capable of discovering more complex RNA sequence arrangements, such as chimeric and circular RNA. STAR can align spliced sequences of any length with moderate error rates, providing scalability for emerging sequencing technologies. STAR generates output files that can be used for many downstream analyses such as transcript/gene expression quantification, differential gene expression, novel isoform reconstruction, and signal visualization. In this unit, we describe computational protocols that produce various output files, use different RNA-seq datatypes, and utilize different mapping strategies. STAR is open source software that can be run on Unix, Linux, or Mac OS X systems. {\copyright} 2015 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

@article{Cymer-2015,
	abstract = {The biogenesis, folding, and structure of α-helical membrane proteins (MPs) are important to understand because they underlie virtually all physiological processes in cells including key metabolic pathways, such as the respiratory chain and the photosystems, as well as the transport of solutes and signals across membranes. Nearly all MPs require translocons---often referred to as protein-conducting channels---for proper insertion into their target membrane. Remarkable progress toward understanding the structure and functioning of translocons has been made during the past decade. Here, we review and assess this progress critically. All available evidence indicates that MPs are equilibrium structures that achieve their final structural states by folding along thermodynamically controlled pathways. The main challenge for cells is the targeting and membrane insertion of highly hydrophobic amino acid sequences. Targeting and insertion are managed in cells principally by interactions between ribosomes and membrane-embedded translocons. Our review examines the biophysical and biological boundaries of MP insertion and the folding of polytopic MPs in vivo. A theme of the review is the under-appreciated role of basic thermodynamic principles in MP folding and assembly. Thermodynamics not only dictates the final folded structure but also is the driving force for the evolution of the ribosome--translocon system of assembly. We conclude the review with a perspective suggesting a new view of translocon-guided MP insertion.},

@article{Jen-Jacobson-2000,
	abstract = {Background: Site-specific protein-DNA complexes vary greatly in structural properties and in the thermodynamic strategy for achieving an appropriate binding free energy. A better understanding of the structural and energetic engineering principles might lead to rational methods for modification or design of such proteins. Results: A novel analysis of ten site-specific protein-DNA complexes reveals a striking correspondence between the degree of imposed DNA distortion and the thermodynamic parameters of each system. For complexes with relatively undistorted DNA, favorable enthalpy change drives unfavorable entropy change, whereas for complexes with highly distorted DNA, unfavorable ΔH$\,^{\circ}$ is driven by favorable ΔS$\,^{\circ}$. We show for the first time that protein-DNA associations have isothermal enthalpy-entropy compensation, distinct from temperature-dependent compensation, so ΔH$\,^{\circ}$ and ΔS$\,^{\circ}$ do not vary independently. All complexes have favorable ΔH$\,^{\circ}$ from direct protein-DNA recognition interactions and favorable ΔS$\,^{\circ}$ from water release. Systems that strongly distort the DNA nevertheless have net unfavorable ΔH$\,^{\circ}$ as the result of molecular strain, primarily associated with the base pair destacking. These systems have little coupled protein folding and the strained interface suffers less immobilization, so ΔS$\,^{\circ}$ is net favorable. By contrast, systems with little DNA distortion have net favorable ΔH$\,^{\circ}$, which must be counterbalanced by net unfavorable ΔS$\,^{\circ}$, derived from loss of vibrational entropy (a result of isothermal enthalpy-entropy compensation) and from coupling between DNA binding and protein folding. Conclusions: Isothermal enthalpy-entropy compensation implies that a structurally optimal, unstrained fit is achieved only at the cost of entropically unfavorable immobilization, whereas an enthalpically weaker, strained interface entails smaller entropic penalties.},

@article{Rohs-2009,
	abstract = {The recognition of specific DNA sequences by proteins is thought to depend on two types of mechanism: one that involves the formation of hydrogen bonds with specific bases, primarily in the major groove, and one involving sequence-dependent deformations of the DNA helix. By comprehensively analysing the three-dimensional structures of protein--DNA complexes, here we show that the binding of arginine residues to narrow minor grooves is a widely used mode for protein--DNA recognition. This readout mechanism exploits the phenomenon that narrow minor grooves strongly enhance the negative electrostatic potential of the DNA. The nucleosome core particle offers a prominent example of this effect. Minor-groove narrowing is often associated with the presence of A-tracts, AT-rich sequences that exclude the flexible TpA step. These findings indicate that the ability to detect local variations in DNA shape and electrostatic potential is a general mechanism that enables proteins to use information in the minor groove, which otherwise offers few opportunities for the formation of base-specific hydrogen bonds, to achieve DNA-binding specificity.},

@article{Rohs-2010,
	abstract = {Specific interactions between proteins and DNA are fundamental to many biological processes. In this review, we provide a revised view of protein-DNA interactions that emphasizes the importance of the three-dimensional structures of both macromolecules. We divide protein-DNA interactions into two categories: those when the protein recognizes the unique chemical signatures of the DNA bases (base readout) and those when the protein recognizes a sequence-dependent DNA shape (shape readout). We further divide base readout into those interactions that occur in the major groove from those that occur in the minor groove. Analogously, the readout of the DNA shape is subdivided into global shape recognition (for example, when the DNA helix exhibits an overall bend) and local shape recognition (for example, when a base pair step is kinked or a region of the minor groove is narrow). Based on the >1500 structures of protein-DNA complexes now available in the Protein Data Bank, we argue that individual DNA-binding proteins combine multiple readout mechanisms to achieve DNA-binding specificity. Specificity that distinguishes between families frequently involves base readout in the major groove, whereas shape readout is often exploited for higher resolution specificity, to distinguish between members within the same DNA-binding protein family.},

	abstract = {{We discuss the effectiveness of existing methods for understanding the forces driving the formation of specific protein--DNA complexes. Theoretical approaches using the Poisson--Boltzmann (PB) equation to analyse interactions between these highly charged macromolecules to form known structures are contrasted with an empirical approach that analyses the effects of salt on the stability of these complexes and assumes that release of counter-ions associated with the free DNA plays the dominant role in their formation. According to this counter-ion condensation (CC) concept, the salt-dependent part of the Gibbs energy of binding, which is defined as the electrostatic component, is fully entropic and its dependence on the salt concentration represents the number of ionic contacts present in the complex. It is shown that although this electrostatic component provides the majority of the Gibbs energy of complex formation and does not depend on the DNA sequence, the salt-independent part of the Gibbs energy---usually regarded as non-electrostatic---is sequence specific. The CC approach thus has considerable practical value for studying protein/DNA complexes, while practical applications of PB analysis have yet to demonstrate their merit.}},

@article{Pal-2006,
	abstract = {A novel, quantitative saturation (QS) scanning strategy was developed to obtain a comprehensive data base of the structural and functional effects of all possible mutations across a large protein-protein interface. The QS scan approach was applied to the high affinity site of human growth hormone (hGH) for binding to its receptor (hGHR). Although the published structure-function data base describing this system is probably the most extensive for any large protein-protein interface, it is nonetheless too sparse to accurately describe the nature of the energetics governing the interaction. Our comprehensive data base affords a complete view of the binding site and provides important new insights into the general principles underlying protein-protein interactions. The hGH binding interface is highly adaptable to mutations, but the nature of the tolerated mutations challenges generally accepted views about the evolutionary and biophysical pressures governing protein-protein interactions. Many substitutions that would be considered chemically conservative are not tolerated, while conversely, many non-conservative substitutions can be accommodated. Furthermore, conservation across species is a poor predictor of the chemical character of tolerated substitutions across the interface. Numerous deviations from generally accepted expectations indicate that mutational tolerance is highly context dependent and, furthermore, cannot be predicted by our current knowledge base. The type of data produced by the comprehensive QS scan can fill the gaps in the structure-function matrix. The compilation of analogous data bases from studies of other protein-protein interactions should greatly aid the development of computational methods for explaining and designing molecular recognition.},

@article{Keeble-2005,
	abstract = {The antibacterial activity of E colicin endonucleases (DNases) is counteracted by the binding of immunity proteins; the affinities of cognate and non-cognate complexes differing by up to ten orders of magnitude. Here, we address the mechanism of complex formation using a combination of protein engineering, pre-steady-state kinetics and isothermal titration calorimetry, in order to understand the underlying basis for specificity. Contrary to previous work, we show that a pre-equilibrium mechanism does not explain the binding kinetics. Instead, the data are best explained by a modified induced-fit mechanism where cognate and non-cognate complexes alike form a non-specific, conformationally dynamic encounter complex, most likely centred on conserved interactions at the interface. The dynamics appear to be an intrinsic property of the encounter complex where the proteins move relative to one another, thereby sampling different conformations rather than being "induced" by binding. This allows optimal alignment of interface specificity sites, without producing energetically costly conformational changes, essential for high-affinity binding. Importantly, specificity is achieved without slowing the rate of association, an important requirement for rapid inhibition of the colicin in the producing bacterial cell. A rigid-body rotation model is also consistent with the observation that specificity contacts in colicin-immunity protein complexes can involve different regions of the interface. Such a kinetic discrimination mechanism explains the ability of DNase-specific immunity proteins to display dual recognition specificity, wherein they are broadly cross-reactive yet are highly specific, achieving femtomolar binding affinities in complexes with their cognate DNases.},

@article{Reichmann-2005,
	abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are essential for life. Yet, our understanding of the general principles governing binding is not complete. In the present study, we show that the interface between proteins is built in a modular fashion; each module is comprised of a number of closely interacting residues, with few interactions between the modules. The boundaries between modules are defined by clustering the contact map of the interface. We show that mutations in one module do not affect residues located in a neighboring module. As a result, the structural and energetic consequences of the deletion of entire modules are surprisingly small. To the contrary, within their module, mutations cause complex energetic and structural consequences. Experimentally, this phenomenon is shown on the interaction between TEM1-beta-lactamase and beta-lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP) by using multiple-mutant analysis and x-ray crystallography. Replacing an entire module of five interface residues with Ala created a large cavity in the interface, with no effect on the detailed structure of the remaining interface. The modular architecture of binding sites, which resembles human engineering design, greatly simplifies the design of new protein interactions and provides a feasible view of how these interactions evolved.},

	abstract = {The past 20 years have seen many advances in our understanding of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and how to target them with small-molecule therapeutics. In 2004, we reviewed some early successes; since then, potent inhibitors have been developed for diverse protein complexes, and compounds are now in clinical trials for six targets. Surprisingly, many of these PPI clinical candidates have efficiency metrics typical of "lead-like" or "drug-like" molecules and are orally available. Successful discovery efforts have integrated multiple disciplines and make use of all the modern tools of target-based discovery-structure, computation, screening, and biomarkers. PPIs become progressively more challenging as the interfaces become more complex, i.e., as binding epitopes are displayed on primary, secondary, or tertiary structures. Here, we review the last 10 years of progress, focusing on the properties of PPI inhibitors that have advanced to clinical trials and prospects for the future of PPI drug discovery.},

@article{Meenan-2010,
	abstract = {High-affinity, high-selectivity protein-protein interactions that are critical for cell survival present an evolutionary paradox: How does selectivity evolve when acquired mutations risk a lethal loss of high-affinity binding? A detailed understanding of selectivity in such complexes requires structural information on weak, noncognate complexes which can be difficult to obtain due to their transient and dynamic nature. Using NMR-based docking as a guide, we deployed a disulfide-trapping strategy on a noncognate complex between the colicin E9 endonuclease (E9 DNase) and immunity protein 2 (Im2), which is seven orders of magnitude weaker binding than the cognate femtomolar E9 DNase-Im9 interaction. The 1.77~{\AA} crystal structure of the E9 DNase-Im2 complex reveals an entirely noncovalent interface where the intersubunit disulfide merely supports the crystal lattice. In combination with computational alanine scanning of interfacial residues, the structure reveals that the driving force for binding is so strong that a severely unfavorable specificity contact is tolerated at the interface and as a result the complex becomes weakened through {\textquotedblleft}frustration.{\textquotedblright} As well as rationalizing past mutational and thermodynamic data, comparing our noncognate structure with previous cognate complexes highlights the importance of loop regions in developing selectivity and accentuates the multiple roles of buried water molecules that stabilize, ameliorate, or aggravate interfacial contacts. The study provides direct support for dual-recognition in colicin DNase-Im protein complexes and shows that weakened noncognate complexes are primed for high-affinity binding, which can be achieved by economical mutation of a limited number of residues at the interface.},

@article{Wells-1996,
	abstract = {Binding reactions between human growth hormone (hGH) and its receptor provide a detailed account of how a polypeptide hormone activates its receptor and more generally how proteins interact. Through high-resolution structural and functional studies it is seen that hGH uses two different sites (site 1 and site 2) to bind two identical receptor molecules. This sequential dimerization reaction activates the receptor, presumably by bringing the intracellular domains into close proximity so they may activate cytosolic components. As a consequence of this mechanism it is possible to build antagonists to the receptor by introducing mutations in hGH that block binding at site 2 and to build even more potent antagonists by combining these with mutants that enhance binding at site 1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of all contact residues at the site 1 interface shows that only a small and complementary set of side chains clustered near the center of the interface affects binding. The most important contacts are hydrophobic, and these are surrounded by polar and charged interactions of lesser importance. Kinetic analysis shows for the most part that the important side chains function to maintain the complex, not to guide the hormone to the receptor. Hormone-induced homodimerization or heterodimerization reactions are turning out to be pervasive mechanisms for signal transduction. Moreover, the molecular recognition principles seen in the hGH-receptor complex are likely to generalize to other protein-protein complexes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Using thiol-specific fluorescence labelling, over 30 putative target proteins of thioredoxin h with diverse structures and functions have been identified in seeds of barley and other plants. To gain insight at the structural level into the specificity of target protein reduction by thioredoxin h, thioredoxin h-reducible disulphide bonds in individual target proteins are identified using a novel strategy based on differential alkylation of cysteine thiol groups by iodoacetamide and 4-vinylpyridine. This method enables the accessible cysteine side chains in the thiol form (carbamidomethylated) to be distinguished from those inaccessible or disulphide bound form (pyridylethylated) according to the mass difference in the peptide mass maps obtained by matrix-assistend laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry. Using this approach, in vitro reduction of disulphides in recombinant barley α-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor (BASI) by barley thioredoxin h isoform 1 was analysed. Furthermore, the method was coupled with two-dimensional electrophoresis for convenient thioredoxin h-reducible disulphide identification in barley seed extracts without the need for protein purification or production of recombinant proteins. Mass shifts of 15 peptides, induced by treatment with thioredoxin h and differential alkylation, identified specific reduction of nine disulphides in BASI, four α-amylase/trypsin inhibitors and a protein of unknown function. Two specific disulphides, located structurally close to the α-amylase binding surfaces of BASI and α-amylase inhibitor BMAI-1 were demonstrated to be reduced to a particularly high extent. For the first time, specificity of thioredoxin h for particular disulphide bonds is demonstrated, providing a basis to study structural aspects of the recognition mechanism and regulation of target proteins.},

	abstract = {Possible target proteins of cytosolic thioredoxin in higher plants have been investigated in the cell lysate of dark-grown Arabidopsis thaliana whole tissues. We immobilized a mutant of cytosolic thioredoxin, in which an internal cysteine at the active site was substituted with serine, on CNBr activated resin, and used the resin for the thioredoxin-affinity chromatography. By using this resin, the target proteins for thioredoxin in the higher plant cytosol were efficiently acquired. The obtained proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Thus we have identified proteins of the anti-oxidative stress system proteins (ascorbate peroxidase, germin-like protein, and monomeric type II peroxiredoxin), proteins involved in protein biosynthesis (elongation factor-2 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A), proteins involved in protein degradation (the regulatory subunit of 26S proteasome), and several metabolic enzymes (alcohol dehydrogenase, fructose 1,6-bis phosphate aldolase-like protein, cytosolic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, and vitamin B(12)-independent methionine synthase) together with some chloroplast proteins (chaperonin 60-alpha and 60-beta, heat shock protein 70, and glutamine synthase). The results in this study and recent proteomics studies on the target proteins of chloroplast thioredoxin indicate the versatility and the physiological significance of thioredoxin as reductant in plant cell.},

For that purpose, we immobilized a mutant of m-type Trx in which an internal cysteine at the active site was substituted with serine, on cyanogen bromide-activated resin. By using this resin, the target proteins in chloroplast were efficiently acquired when they formed the mixed-disulfide intermediates with the immobilized Trxs. We could acquire Rubisco activase (45 kDa) and 2-Cys-type peroxiredoxin (Prx), which were recently identified as targets of chloroplast Trxs. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and sedoheputulose 1,7-bisphosphatase, well-known thiol enzymes in the Calvin cycle, also were recognized among the collected proteins, suggesting the method is applicable for our purpose. Furthermore, four proteins were identified from a homology search of the NH2-terminal sequence of the acquired proteins: glutamine synthetase, a protein homologous to chloroplast cyclophilin, a homolog of Prx-Q, and the Rubisco small subunit. The Trx susceptibilities of the recombinant cyclophilin and Prx-Q of Arabidopsis thaliana were then examined. The method developed in the present study is thus applicable to investigate the various redox networks via Trxs and the related enzymes in the cell.

	abstract = {Disruption of the two thioredoxin genes in yeast dramatically affects cell viability and growth. Expression of Arabidopsis thioredoxin AtTRX3 in the Saccharomyces thioredoxin Delta strain EMY63 restores a wild-type cell cycle, the ability to grow on methionine sulfoxide, and H2O2 tolerance. In order to isolate thioredoxin targets related to these phenotypes, we prepared a C35S (Escherichia coli numbering) thioredoxin mutant to stabilize the intermediate disulfide bridged complex and we added a polyhistidine N-terminal extension in order to purify the complex rapidly. Expression of this mutant thioredoxin in the wild-type yeast induces a reduced tolerance to H2O2, but only limited change in the cell cycle and no change in methionine sulfoxide utilization. Expression in the Delta thioredoxin strain EMY63 allowed us to isolate a complex of the thioredoxin with YLR109, an abundant yeast protein related to PMP20, a peroxisomal protein of Candida. No function has so far been attributed to this protein or to the other numerous homologues described in plants, animals, fungi, and prokaryotes. On the basis of the complementation and of low similarity with peroxiredoxins, we produced YLR109 and one of its Arabidopsis homologues in E. coli to test their peroxiredoxins activity. We demonstrate that both recombinant proteins present a thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activity in vitro. The possible functions of this new peroxiredoxin family are discussed.},

A more limited reduction of certain members of these protein groups was achieved with the reduced form of glutathione or glutaredoxin, a protein known to replace thioredoxin in certain bacterial and mammalian enzyme systems but not known to occur in higher plants. Endosperm extracts contained the enzymes necessary to reduce NADP by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase). The gliadins and glutenins were also reduced in vivo during germination--an event that accompanied their proteolytic breakdown. The results suggest that thioredoxin, reduced by NADPH generated via the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, functions as a signal in germination to enhance metabolic processes such as the mobilization of storage proteins and, as found earlier, the activation of enzymes.},

	abstract = {Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of chloroplast metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In addition, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning chloroplast function is to establish the relationship between these two redox systems and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs f, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx x, which has antioxidant function. The ntrc-trxf1f2 and, to a lower extent, ntrc-trxx mutants showed severe growth-retarded phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant chloroplast ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the ntrc-trxf1f2 and ntrc-trxx mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the addition of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in chloroplast redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons chloroplasts, which is essential for early plant development.GlossaryFdxferredoxinRT-qPCRreal-time quantitative PCRNPQnonphotochemical quenchingETRelectron transport rateMSMurashige and Skoog},

Recent Advances: This review highlights established and novel thiol-based regulatory pathways underlying the functional facets and significance of redox biology in photosynthetic organisms. In the last decades, the field of redox regulation has largely expanded and this work is aimed at giving the right credit to the importance of thiol-based regulatory and signaling mechanisms in plants. Critical Issues: This cannot be all-encompassing, but is intended to provide a comprehensive overview on the structural/molecular mechanisms governing the most relevant thiol switching modifications with emphasis on the large genetic and functional diversity of redox controllers (i.e., redoxins). We also summarize the different proteomic-based approaches aimed at investigating the dynamics of redox modifications and the recent evidence that extends the possibility to monitor the cellular redox state in vivo. The physiological relevance of redox transitions is discussed based on reverse genetic studies confirming the importance of redox homeostasis in plant growth, development, and stress responses. Future Directions: In conclusion, we can firmly assume that redox biology has acquired an established significance that virtually infiltrates all aspects of plant physiology. },

	abstract = {Abstract Thioredoxins (TRXs) are important proteins involved in redox regulation of metabolism. In plants, it has been shown that the mitochondrial metabolism is regulated by the mitochondrial TRX system. However, the functional significance of TRX h2, which is found at both cytosol and mitochondria, remains unclear. Arabidopsis plants lacking TRX h2 showed delayed seed germination and reduced respiration alongside impaired stomatal and mesophyll conductance, without impacting photosynthesis under ambient O2 conditions. However, an increase in the stoichiometry of photorespiratory CO2 release was found during O2-dependent gas exchange measurements in trxh2 mutants. Metabolite profiling of trxh2 leaves revealed alterations in key metabolites of photorespiration and in several metabolites involved in respiration and amino acid metabolism. Decreased abundance of serine hydroxymethyltransferase and glycine decarboxylase (GDC) H and L subunits as well as reduced NADH/NAD+ ratios were also observed in trxh2 mutants. We further demonstrated that the redox status of GDC-L is altered in trxh2 mutants in vivo and that recombinant TRX h2 can deactivate GDC-L in vitro, indicating that this protein is redox regulated by the TRX system. Collectively, our results demonstrate that TRX h2 plays an important role in the redox regulation of mitochondrial photorespiratory metabolism.},

	abstract = {NADPH-thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC) forms a separate thiol-reduction cascade in plastids, combining both NADPH-thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin activities on a single polypeptide. While NTRC is an important regulator of photosynthetic processes in leaves, its function in heterotrophic tissues remains unclear. Here, we focus on the role of NTRC in developing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruits representing heterotrophic storage organs important for agriculture and human diet. We used a fruit-specific promoter to decrease NTRC expression by RNA interference in developing tomato fruits by 60\% to 80\% compared to the wild type. This led to a decrease in fruit growth, resulting in smaller and lighter fully ripe fruits containing less dry matter and more water. In immature fruits, NTRC downregulation decreased transient starch accumulation, which led to a subsequent decrease in soluble sugars in ripe fruits. The inhibition of starch synthesis was associated with a decrease in the redox-activation state of ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase and soluble starch synthase, which catalyze the first committed and final polymerizing steps, respectively, of starch biosynthesis. This was accompanied by a decrease in the level of ADP-Glc. NTRC downregulation also led to a strong increase in the reductive states of NAD(H) and NADP(H) redox systems. Metabolite profiling of NTRC-RNA interference lines revealed increased organic and amino acid levels, but reduced sugar levels, implying that NTRC regulates the osmotic balance of developing fruits. These results indicate that NTRC acts as a central hub in regulating carbon metabolism and redox balance in heterotrophic tomato fruits, affecting fruit development as well as final fruit size and quality.},

In recent years, reverse genetics and biochemical approaches were used to resolve the functions, specificities, and interactions of the different thioredoxin isoforms and reduction systems in planta and revealed the most versatile thioredoxin system of all organisms. Here we review the emerging roles of the thioredoxin system, namely the integration of thylakoid energy transduction, metabolism, gene expression, growth, and development under fluctuating environmental conditions. We argue that these new developments help us to understand why plants organize such a divergent composition of thiol redox networks and provide insights into the regulatory hierarchy that operates between them.},

@article{Maier-2012,
	abstract = {The photorespiratory pathway helps illuminated C<sub>3</sub>-plants under conditions of limited CO<sub>2</sub> availability by effectively exporting reducing equivalents in form of glycolate out of the chloroplast and regenerating glycerate-3-P as substrate for RubisCO. On the other hand, this pathway is considered as probably futile because previously assimilated CO<sub>2</sub> is released in mitochondria. Consequently, a lot of effort has been made to reduce this CO<sub>2</sub> loss either by reducing fluxes via engineering RubisCO or circumventing mitochondrial CO<sub>2</sub> release by the introduction of new enzyme activities. Here we present an approach following the latter route, introducing a complete glycolate catabolic cycle in chloroplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana comprising glycolate oxidase (GO), malate synthase (MS), and catalase (CAT). Results from plants bearing both GO and MS activities have already been reported (Fahnenstich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>). This previous work showed that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by GO had strongly negative effects. These effects can be prevented by introducing a plastidial catalase activity, as reported here. Transgenic lines bearing all three transgenic enzyme activities were identified and some with higher CAT activity showed higher dry weight, higher photosynthetic rates, and changes in glycine/serine ratio compared to the wild type. This indicates that the fine-tuning of transgenic enzyme activities in the chloroplasts seems crucial and strongly suggests that the approach is valid and that it is possible to improve the growth of A. thaliana by introducing a synthetic glycolate oxidative cycle into chloroplasts.},

@article{Carvalho-2011,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The photorespiratory nitrogen cycle in C₃plants involves an extensive diversion of carbon and nitrogen away from the direct pathways of assimilation. The liberated ammonia is re-assimilated, but up to 25% of the carbon may be released into the atmosphere as CO₂. Because of the loss of CO₂ and high energy costs, there has been considerable interest in attempts to decrease the flux through the cycle in C₃ plants. Transgenic tobacco plants were generated that contained the genes gcl and hyi from E. coli encoding glyoxylate carboligase (EC 4.1.1.47) and hydroxypyruvate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.22) respectively, targeted to the peroxisomes. It was presumed that the two enzymes could work together and compete with the aminotransferases that convert glyoxylate to glycine, thus avoiding ammonia production in the photorespiratory nitrogen cycle. RESULTS: When grown in ambient air, but not in elevated CO₂, the transgenic tobacco lines had a distinctive phenotype of necrotic lesions on the leaves. Three of the six lines chosen for a detailed study contained single copies of the gcl gene, two contained single copies of both the gcl and hyi genes and one line contained multiple copies of both gcl and hyi genes. The gcl protein was detected in the five transgenic lines containing single copies of the gcl gene but hyi protein was not detected in any of the transgenic lines. The content of soluble amino acids including glycine and serine, was generally increased in the transgenic lines growing in air, when compared to the wild type. The content of soluble sugars, glucose, fructose and sucrose in the shoot was decreased in transgenic lines growing in air, consistent with decreased carbon assimilation. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco plants have been generated that produce bacterial glyoxylate carboligase but not hydroxypyruvate isomerase. The transgenic plants exhibit a stress response when exposed to air, suggesting that some glyoxylate is diverted away from conversion to glycine in a deleterious short-circuit of the photorespiratory nitrogen cycle. This diversion in metabolism gave rise to increased concentrations of amino acids, in particular glutamine and asparagine in the leaves and a decrease of soluble sugars.},

	abstract = {We introduced the Escherichia coli glycolate catabolic pathway into Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts to reduce the loss of fixed carbon and nitrogen that occurs in C(3) plants when phosphoglycolate, an inevitable by-product of photosynthesis, is recycled by photorespiration. Using step-wise nuclear transformation with five chloroplast-targeted bacterial genes encoding glycolate dehydrogenase, glyoxylate carboligase and tartronic semialdehyde reductase, we generated plants in which chloroplastic glycolate is converted directly to glycerate. This reduces, but does not eliminate, flux of photorespiratory metabolites through peroxisomes and mitochondria. Transgenic plants grew faster, produced more shoot and root biomass, and contained more soluble sugars, reflecting reduced photorespiration and enhanced photosynthesis that correlated with an increased chloroplastic CO(2) concentration in the vicinity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. These effects are evident after overexpression of the three subunits of glycolate dehydrogenase, but enhanced by introducing the complete bacterial glycolate catabolic pathway. Diverting chloroplastic glycolate from photorespiration may improve the productivity of crops with C(3) photosynthesis.},

Depending on growing temperatures, photorespiration can reduce yields by 20 to 50% in C(3) crops. Inspired by earlier work, we installed into tobacco chloroplasts synthetic glycolate metabolic pathways that are thought to be more efficient than the native pathway. Flux through the synthetic pathways was maximized by inhibiting glycolate export from the chloroplast. The synthetic pathways tested improved photosynthetic quantum yield by 20%. Numerous homozygous transgenic lines increased biomass productivity by >40% in replicated field trials.

Several approaches aimed at reducing the rates of photorespiratory energy or carbon loss have been proposed, based either on screening for natural variation or by means of genetic engineering. Recent work indicates that plant yield can be substantially improved by the alteration of photorespiratory fluxes or by engineering artificial bypasses to photorespiration. However, there is also evidence indicating that, under certain environmental and/or nutritional conditions, reduced photorespiratory capacity may be detrimental to plant performance. Here we summarize recent advances obtained in photorespiratory engineering and discuss prospects for these advances to be transferred to major crops to help address the globally increasing demand for food and biomass production.},

	abstract = {Bypassing the photorespiratory pathway is regarded as a way to increase carbon assimilation and, correspondingly, biomass production in C3 crops. Here, the benefits of three published photorespiratory bypass strategies are systemically explored using a systems-modeling approach. Our analysis shows that full decarboxylation of glycolate during photorespiration would decrease photosynthesis, because a large amount of the released CO2 escapes back to the atmosphere. Furthermore, we show that photosynthesis can be enhanced by lowering the energy demands of photorespiration and by relocating photorespiratory CO2 release into the chloroplasts. The conductance of the chloroplast membranes to CO2 is a key feature determining the benefit of the relocation of photorespiratory CO2 release. Although our results indicate that the benefit of photorespiratory bypasses can be improved by increasing sedoheptulose bisphosphatase activity and/or increasing the flux through the bypass, the effectiveness of such approaches depends on the complex regulation between photorespiration and other metabolic pathways.GlossaryRuBPribulose bisphosphatePGA3-phosphoglycerateCBBCalvin-Benson-BasshamP-Gly2-phosphoglycolateSc/ospecificity of Rubisco to CO2 versus oxygenCiintercellular CO2 concentrationgchlconductance of CO2 between the cytosol and the site of fixation in the chloroplast stromaSBPasesedoheptulose bisphosphataseGDHglycolate dehydrogenasePEPcphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylasePARphotosynthetically active radiation},

	abstract = {Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Samsun) plants with reduced levels of the Calvin cycle enzyme sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase; EC 3.1.3.37) were produced using an antisense construct in which the expression of a tobacco SBPase cDNA clone was driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter. The reduction in SBPase protein levels observed in the primary transformants correlated with the presence of the antisense construct and lower levels of the endogenous SBPase mRNA. No changes in the amounts of other Calvin cycle enzymes were detected using Western blot analysis. The SBPase antisense plants with less than 20{\%} of wild-type SBPase activity were observed to display a range of phenotypes, including chlorosis and reduced growth rates. Measurements of photosynthesis, using both light-dosage response and CO2 response curves, of T1 plants revealed a reduction in carbon assimilation rates, which was apparent in plants retaining 57{\%} of wild-type SBPase activity. Reductions were also observed in the quantum efficiency of photosystem II. This decrease in photosynthetic capacity was reflected in a reduction in the carbohydrate content of leaves. Analysis of carbohydrate status in fully expanded source leaves showed a shift in carbon allocation away from starch, whilst sucrose levels were maintained in all but the most severely affected plants. Plants with less than 15{\%} of wild-type SBPase activity were found to contain less than 5{\%} of wild-type starch levels. The results of this preliminary analysis indicate that SBPase activity may limit the rate of carbon assimilation.},

We have tested the possibility that SS mRNA or protein levels affect LS mRNA amounts or LS protein production and accumulation. We find that expression of antisense DNA sequences for the SS in transgenic tobacco plants drastically reduces the accumulation of SS mRNA and SS protein. These changes are accompanied by corresponding reductions of LS protein but not LS mRNA amounts; accumulation of the LS protein appears to be regulated by translational and posttranslational factors. We also find that the transgenic plants display striking variations in growth that are correlated with antisense gene dosage.},

@article{Quick-1992,
	abstract = {The effect of nitrogen supply during growth on the contribution of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco; EC 4.1.1.39) to the control of photosynthesis was examined in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Transgenic plants transformed with antisense rbcS to produce a series of plants with a progressive decrease in the amount of Rubisco were used to allow the calculation of the flux-control coefficient of Rubisco for photosynthesis (CR). Several points emerged from the data: (i) The strength of Rubisco control of photosynthesis, as measured by CR, was altered by changes in the short-term environmental conditions. Generally, CR was increased in conditions of increased irradiance or decreased CO2. (ii) The amount of Rubisco in wild-type plants was reduced as the nitrogen supply during growth was reduced and this was associated with an increase in CR. This implied that there was a specific reduction in the amount of Rubisco compared with other components of the photosynthetic machinery. (iii) Plants grown with low nitrogen and which had genetically reduced levels of Rubisco had a higher chlorophyll content and a lower chlorophyll a/b ratio than wild-type plants. This indicated that the nitrogen made available by genetically reducing the amount of Rubisco had been re-allocated to other cellular components including light-harvesting and electron-transport proteins. It is argued that there is a "luxury" additional investment of nitrogen into Rubisco in tobacco plants grown in high nitrogen, and that Rubisco can also be considered a nitrogen-store, all be it one where the opportunity cost of the nitrogen storage is higher than in a non-functional storage protein (i.e. it allows for a slightly higher water-use efficiency and for photosynthesis to respond to temporarily high irradiance).},

@article{Quick-1991,
	abstract = {Experiments were carried out to determine how decreased expression of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) affects photosynthetic metabolism in ambient growth conditions. In a series of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants containing progressively smaller amounts of Rubisco the rate of photosynthesis was measured under conditions similar to those in which the plants had been grown (310 μmol photons · m(-2) · s(-1), 350 μbar CO2, 22$\,^{\circ}$ C). (i) There was only a marginal inhibition (6%) of photosynthesis when Rubisco was decreased to about 60% of the amount in the wildtype. The reduced amount of Rubisco was compensated for by an increase in Rubisco activation (rising from 60 to 100%), with minor contributions from an increase of its substrates (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate and the internal CO2 concentration) and a decrease of its product (glycerate-3-phosphate). (ii) The decreased amount of Rubisco was accompanied by an increased ATP/ADP ratio that may be causally linked to the increased activation of Rubisco. An increase of highenergy-state chlorophyll fluorescence shows that thylakoid membrane energisation and high-energy-state-dependent energy dissipation at photosystem two had also increased. (iii) A further decrease of Rubisco (in the range of 50-20% of the wildtype level) resulted in a strong and proportional inhibition of CO2 assimilation. This was accompanied by a decrease of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity, coupling-factor 1 (CF1)-ATP-synthase protein, NADP-malate dehydrogenase protein, and chlorophyll. The chlorophyll a/b ratio did not change, and enolase and sucrose-phosphate synthase activity did not decrease. It is argued that other photosynthetic enzymes are also decreased once Rubisco decreases to the point at which it becomes strongly limiting for photosynthesis. (iv) It is proposed that the amount of Rubisco in the wildtype represents a balance between the demands of light, water and nitrogen utilisation. The wildtype overinvests about 15% more protein in Rubisco than is needed to avoid a strict Rubisco limitation of photosynthesis. However, this "excess" Rubisco allows the wildtype to operate with lower thylakoid energisation, and decreased high-energy-state-dependent energy dissipation, hence increasing light-use efficiency by about 6%. It also allows the wildtype to operate with a lower internal CO2 concentration in the leaf and a lower stomatal conductance at a given rate of photosynthesis, so that instantaneous water-use efficiency is marginally (8%) increased.},

@article{Haake-1998,
	abstract = {Summary Antisense expression of a full length cDNA encoding plastid aldolase led to decreased expression of aldolase at the transcript and protein level in several `antisense' potato transformants. To quantify the inhibition, activity was compared in corresponding leaves down a plant and in plants of different ages. Aldolase activity was decreased by 32--43\%, 56--71\%, 79--83\% and 91--97\% in A-70, A-3, A-51 and A-2. Separation on a Q-Sepharose--FF column showed the decrease was due to inhibition of plastid aldolase. The transformants showed a small increase of Rubisco activity, a small decrease of phosphoribulokinase activity, and larger but subproportional decreases of sedoheptulose-1,7-biphosphatase and plastid fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity. Ambient photosynthesis was inhibited by 10\%, 40\%, 66\% and 85\% in A-70, A-3, A-51 and A-2. The transformants contained increased triose phosphates, and very low ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate and glycerate-3-phosphate. Chlorophyll fluorescence indicated that photosystem II was more reduced and thylakoid energization was increased. Starch synthesis was decreased by 16\% and 36\% in A-70 and A-3, whereas sucrose synthesis was less strongly inhibited. Plant growth was not significantly altered in A-70, was decreased by 41\% in A-3, and was severely inhibited in plants with under 20\% of wild-type aldolase activity. Although plastid aldolase catalyses a readily reversible reaction, possesses no known regulatory properties, and would appear irrelevant for the control of metabolism and growth, small changes in its activity have marked consequences for photosynthesis, carbon partitioning and growth.},

	abstract = {We describe a novel, typically prokaryotic, sensor kinase in chloroplasts of green plants. The gene for this chloroplast sensor kinase (CSK) is found in cyanobacteria, prokaryotes from which chloroplasts evolved. The CSK gene has moved, during evolution, from the ancestral chloroplast to the nuclear genomes of eukaryotic algae and green plants. The CSK protein is now synthesised in the cytosol of photosynthetic eukaryotes and imported into their chloroplasts as a protein precursor. In the model higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana, CSK is autophosphorylated and required for control of transcription of chloroplast genes by the redox state of an electron carrier connecting photosystems I and II. CSK therefore provides a redox regulatory mechanism that couples photosynthesis to gene expression. This mechanism is inherited directly from the cyanobacterial ancestor of chloroplasts, is intrinsic to chloroplasts, and is targeted to chloroplast genes.},

@article{Longoni-2015,
	abstract = {Light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) is a crucial component of the photosynthetic machinery, with central roles in light capture and acclimation to changing light. The association of an LHCII trimer with PSI in the PSI-LHCII supercomplex is strictly dependent on LHCII phosphorylation mediated by the kinase STATE TRANSITION7, and is directly related to the light acclimation process called state transitions. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the LHCII trimers contain isoforms that belong to three classes: Lhcb1, Lhcb2, and Lhcb3. Only Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 can be phosphorylated in the N-terminal region. Here, we present an improved Phos-tag-based method to determine the absolute extent of phosphorylation of Lhcb1 and Lhcb2. Both classes show very similar phosphorylation kinetics during state transition. Nevertheless, only Lhcb2 is extensively phosphorylated (>98%) in PSI-LHCII, whereas phosphorylated Lhcb1 is largely excluded from this supercomplex. Both isoforms are phosphorylated to different extents in other photosystem supercomplexes and in different domains of the thylakoid membranes. The data imply that, despite their high sequence similarity, differential phosphorylation of Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 plays contrasting roles in light acclimation of photosynthesis.},

@article{Takahashi-2013,
	abstract = {Photosynthesis is the biological process that feeds the biosphere with reduced carbon. The assimilation of CO2 requires the fine tuning of two co-existing functional modes: linear electron flow, which provides NADPH and ATP, and cyclic electron flow, which only sustains ATP synthesis. Although the importance of this fine tuning is appreciated, its mechanism remains equivocal. Here we show that cyclic electron flow as well as formation of supercomplexes, thought to contribute to the enhancement of cyclic electron flow, are promoted in reducing conditions with no correlation with the reorganization of the thylakoid membranes associated with the migration of antenna proteins towards Photosystems I or II, a process known as state transition. We show that cyclic electron flow is tuned by the redox power and this provides a mechanistic model applying to the entire green lineage including the vast majority of the cases in which state transition only involves a moderate fraction of the antenna.},

This was accomplished by introducing the Lhcb2.1 coding region in the antisense orientation into the genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 were absent, while Lhcb3, a protein present in LHC II associated with photosystem (PS) II, was retained. Plants had a pale green appearance and showed reduced chlorophyll content and an elevated chlorophyll a/b ratio. The content of PS II reaction centres was unchanged on a leaf area basis, but there was evidence for increases in the relative levels of other light harvesting proteins, notably CP26, associated with PS II, and Lhca4, associated with PS I. Electron microscopy showed the presence of grana. Photosynthetic rates at saturating irradiance were the same in wild-type and antisense plants, but there was a 10-15% reduction in quantum yield that reflected the decrease in light absorption by the leaf. The antisense plants were not able to perform state transitions, and their capacity for non-photochemical quenching was reduced. There was no difference in growth between wild-type and antisense plants under controlled climate conditions, but the antisense plants performed worse compared to the wild type in the field, with decreases in seed production of up to 70%.},

@article{Bellafiore-2005,
	abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms are able to adjust to changing light conditions through state transitions, a process that involves the redistribution of light excitation energy between photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI). Balancing of the light absorption capacity of these two photosystems is achieved through the reversible association of the major antenna complex (LHCII) between PSII and PSI (ref. 3). Excess stimulation of PSII relative to PSI leads to the reduction of the plastoquinone pool and the activation of a kinase; the phosphorylation of LHCII; and the displacement of LHCII from PSII to PSI (state 2). Oxidation of the plastoquinone pool by excess stimulation of PSI reverses this process (state 1). The Chlamydomonas thylakoid-associated Ser-Thr kinase Stt7, which is required for state transitions, has an orthologue named STN7 in Arabidopsis. Here we show that loss of STN7 blocks state transitions and LHCII phosphorylation. In stn7 mutant plants the plastoquinone pool is more reduced and growth is impaired under changing light conditions, indicating that STN7, and probably state transitions, have an important role in response to environmental changes.},

	abstract = {A positively charged amino acid sequence, located on the NH2 terminus of the polypeptides of the chlorophyll a/b light harvesting complex, stabilizes thylakoid membrane adhesion. Threonine residues in this segment are the site of light-induced, reversible phosphorylation; this covalent modification results in changes in excitation-energy distribution in chloroplast membranes. Removal of the positively charged peptide by treatment with trypsin or chemical modification of amino acids in the sequence disrupts thylakoid adhesion and inhibits regulation of excitation-energy distribution. Purified preparations of the chlorophyll a/b light harvesting complex consist of 2 major polypeptides of 27 and 26 kDa and 2 minor polypeptides of 29 and 25 kDa (based upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Trypsin treatment of the isolated chlorophyll proteins decreases the apparent molecular mass of the 27- and 26-kDa polypeptides by 1-1.5 kDa and releases 3 peptides; [Lys, Arg], Ser-Ala-Thr-Thr-Lys-Lys, and Ser-Ala-Thr-Thr-Lys. These peptides probably form the overlap sequence, [Lys, Arg]-Ser-Ala-Thr-Thr-Lys-Lys. The polypeptides of the chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting complex were separated by isoelectric focusing into 5 chlorophyll protein fractions which had isoelectric points between 4.0 and 4.55. The 27-kDa polypeptides had an isoelectric point of 4.3, and bound 11 chlorophyll molecules/polypeptide.},

LHC-II is the prototype of a highly conserved family of membrane proteins that fuels plant photosynthesis in the conversion of excitation energy into biologically useful chemical energy. In addition, LHC-II plays an important role in the organisation of the thylakoid membrane, the structure of the photosynthetic apparatus, the regulation of energy flow between the two photosystems, and in the controlled dissipation of excess excitation energy under light stress. Our current understanding of the sophisticated mechanisms behind each of these processes has profited greatly from the progress made over the past two decades in determining the structure of the complex. This review presents the developments and breakthroughs that ultimately lead to the high-resolution structure of LHC-II. Based on an alignment of the remarkably well engineered and highly conserved LHC polypeptide, we propose several key features of the LHC-II structure that are likely to be present in all members of the LHC family. Finally, some recently proposed mechanisms of energy-dependent non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) are examined from a structural perspective.},

	abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms have the ability to adapt to changes in light quality by readjusting the cross sections of the light-harvesting systems of photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI). This process, called state transitions, maintains the redox poise of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and ensures a high photosynthetic yield when light is limiting. It is mediated by the Stt7/STN7 protein kinase, which is activated through the cytochrome b6f complex upon reduction of the plastoquinone pool. Its probable major substrate, the light-harvesting complex of PSII, once phosphorylated, dissociates from PSII and docks to PSI, thereby restoring the balance of absorbed light excitation energy between the two photosystems. Although the kinase is known to be inactivated under high-light intensities, the molecular mechanisms governing its regulation remain unknown. In this study we monitored the redox state of a conserved and essential Cys pair of the Stt7/STN7 kinase and show that it forms a disulfide bridge. We could not detect any change in the redox state of these Cys during state transitions and high-light treatment. It is only after prolonged anaerobiosis that this disulfide bridge is reduced. It is likely to be mainly intramolecular, although kinase activation may involve a transient covalently linked kinase dimer with two intermolecular disulfide bonds. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have mapped one interaction site of the kinase on the Rieske protein of the cytochrome b6f complex.GlossaryLHCIIlight-harvesting complex of PSIIPQplastoquinonePSIphotosystem IPSIIphotosystem II},

	abstract = {In oxygenic photosynthesis there are two `light states' -- adaptations of the photosynthetic apparatus to spectral composition that otherwise favours either photosystem I or photosystem II. In chloroplasts of green plants the transition to light state 2 depends on phosphorylation of apoproteins of a membrane-intrinsic antenna, the chlorophyll-a/b-binding, light-harvesting complex II (LHC II), and on the resulting redistribution of absorbed excitation energy from photosystem II to photosystem I. The transition to light state 1 reverses these events and requires a phospho-LHC II phosphatase. Current structures of LHC II reveal little about possible steric effects of phosphorylation. The surface-exposed N-terminal domain of an LHC II polypeptide contains its phosphorylation site and is disordered in its unphosphorylated form. A molecular recognition hypothesis proposes that state transitions are a consequence of movement of LHC II between binding sites on photosystems I and II. In state 1, LHC II forms part of the antenna of photosystem II. In state 2, a unique but as yet unidentified 3-D structure of phospho-LHC II may attach it instead to photosystem I. One possibility is that the LHC II N-terminus becomes ordered upon phosphorylation, adopting a local alpha-helical secondary structure that initiates changes in LHC II tertiary and quaternary structure that sever contact with photosystem II while securing contact with photosystem I. In order to understand redistribution of absorbed excitation energy in photosynthesis we need to know the structure of LHC II in its phosphorylated form, and in its complex with photosystem I.},

@article{Galka-2012,
	abstract = {State transitions are an important photosynthetic short-term response that allows energy distribution balancing between photosystems I (PSI) and II (PSII). In plants when PSII is preferentially excited compared with PSI (State II), part of the major light-harvesting complex LHCII migrates to PSI to form a PSI-LHCII supercomplex. So far, little is known about this complex, mainly due to purification problems. Here, a stable PSI-LHCII supercomplex is purified from Arabidopsis thaliana and maize (Zea mays) plants. It is demonstrated that LHCIIs loosely bound to PSII in State I are the trimers mainly involved in state transitions and become strongly bound to PSI in State II. Specific Lhcb1-3 isoforms are differently represented in the mobile LHCII compared with S and M trimers. Fluorescence analyses indicate that excitation energy migration from mobile LHCII to PSI is rapid and efficient, and the quantum yield of photochemical conversion of PSI-LHCII is substantially unaffected with respect to PSI, despite a sizable increase of the antenna size. An updated PSI-LHCII structural model suggests that the low-energy chlorophylls 611 and 612 in LHCII interact with the chlorophyll 11145 at the interface of PSI. In contrast with the common opinion, we suggest that the mobile pool of LHCII may be considered an intimate part of the PSI antenna system that is displaced to PSII in State I.GlossaryPSIphotosystem IPSIIphotosystem IIEETexcitation energy transferα-DMn-dodecyl-α-d-maltosideMSmass spectrometryDASdecay-associated spectraCDcircular dichroismLHCIlight-harvesting complex ILHCIIlight-harvesting complex II},

	abstract = { Photosynthetic electron transport regulates chloroplast gene transcription through the action of a bacterial-type sensor kinase known as chloroplast sensor kinase (CSK). CSK represses photosystem I (PS I) gene transcription in PS I light and thus initiates photosystem stoichiometry adjustment. In cyanobacteria and in non-green algae, CSK homologues co-exist with their response regulator partners in canonical bacterial two-component systems. In green algae and plants, however, no response regulator partner of CSK is found. Yeast two-hybrid analysis has revealed interaction of CSK with sigma factor 1 (SIG1) of chloroplast RNA polymerase. Here we present further evidence for the interaction between CSK and SIG1. We also show that CSK interacts with quinone. Arabidopsis SIG1 becomes phosphorylated in PS I light, which then specifically represses transcription of PS I genes. In view of the identical signalling properties of CSK and SIG1 and of their interactions, we suggest that CSK is a SIG1 kinase. We propose that the selective repression of PS I genes arises from the operation of a gene-regulatory phosphoswitch in SIG1. The CSK-SIG1 system represents a novel, rewired chloroplast-signalling pathway created by evolutionary tinkering. This regulatory system supports a proposal for the selection pressure behind the evolutionary stasis of chloroplast genes. },

	abstract = { Photosynthetic organisms are subjected to frequent changes in light quality and quantity and need to respond accordingly. These acclimatory processes are mediated to a large extent through thylakoid protein phosphorylation. Recently, two major thylakoid protein kinases have been identified and characterized. The Stt7/STN7 kinase is mainly involved in the phosphorylation of the LHCII antenna proteins and is required for state transitions. It is firmly associated with the cytochrome b6f complex, and its activity is regulated by the redox state of the plastoquinone pool. The other kinase, Stl1/STN8, is responsible for the phosphorylation of the PSII core proteins. Using a reverse genetics approach, we have recently identified the chloroplast PPH1/TAP38 and PBPC protein phosphatases, which counteract the activity of STN7 and STN8 kinases, respectively. They belong to the PP2C-type phosphatase family and are conserved in land plants and algae. The picture that emerges from these studies is that of a complex regulatory network of chloroplast protein kinases and phosphatases that is involved in light acclimation, in maintenance of the plastoquinone redox poise under fluctuating light and in the adjustment to metabolic needs. },

	abstract = { Photosynthetic organisms are continuously subjected to changes in light quantity and quality, and must adjust their photosynthetic machinery so that it maintains optimal performance under limiting light and minimizes photodamage under excess light. To achieve this goal, these organisms use two main strategies in which light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), the light-harvesting system of photosystem II (PSII), plays a key role both for the collection of light energy and for photoprotection. The first is energy-dependent nonphotochemical quenching, whereby the high-light-induced proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane triggers a process in which excess excitation energy is harmlessly dissipated as heat. The second involves a redistribution of the mobile LHCII between the two photosystems in response to changes in the redox poise of the electron transport chain sensed through a signaling chain. These two processes strongly diminish the production of damaging reactive oxygen species, but photodamage of PSII is unavoidable, and it is repaired efficiently. },

The latter pathway generates more ATP but the molecular components of the supercomplex involved in the process have remained elusive. This issue is now addressed directly in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. A combination of biochemical and spectroscopic techniques reveals the supercomplex that drives cyclic electron flow to be made up not only of the photosystem/peripheral antenna supercomplex, but also of two known redox proteins ---cytochrome b6f complex and ferredoxin-NADPH oxidoreductase (FNR) ---with a few small proteins as well.},

During exercise, it is activated in skeletal muscle in humans, and at least in rodents, also in adipose tissue, liver and perhaps other organs by events that increase the AMP/ATP ratio. When activated, AMPK stimulates energy-generating processes such as glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation and decreases energy-consuming processes such as protein and lipid synthesis. Exercise is perhaps the most powerful physiological activator of AMPK and a unique model for studying its many physiological roles. In addition, it improves the metabolic status of rodents with a metabolic syndrome phenotype, as does treatment with AMPK-activating agents; it is therefore tempting to attribute the therapeutic benefits of regular physical activity to activation of AMPK. Here we review the acute and chronic effects of exercise on AMPK activity in skeletal muscle and other tissues. We also discuss the potential role of AMPK activation in mediating the prevention and treatment by exercise of specific disorders associated with the metabolic syndrome, including Type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.}},

@article{Maarbjerg-2011,
	abstract = {Abstract Exercise counteracts insulin resistance and improves glucose homeostasis in many ways. Apart from increasing muscle glucose uptake quickly, exercise also clearly increases muscle insulin sensitivity in the post-exercise period. This review will focus on the mechanisms responsible for this increased insulin sensitivity. It is believed that increased sarcolemmal content of the glucose transporter GLUT4 can explain the phenomenon to some extent. Surprisingly no improvement in the proximal insulin signalling pathway is observed at the level of the insulin receptor, IRS1, PI3K or Akt. Recently more distal signalling component in the insulin signalling pathway such as aPKC, Rac1, TBC1D4 and TBC1D1 have been described. These are all affected by both insulin and exercise which means that they are likely converging points in promoting GLUT4 translocation and therefore possible candidates for regulating insulin sensitivity after exercise. Whereas TBC1D1 does not appear to regulate insulin sensitivity after exercise, correlative evidence in contrast suggests TBC1D4 to be a relevant candidate. Little is known about aPKC and Rac1 in relation to insulin sensitivity after exercise. Besides mechanisms involved in signalling to GLUT4 translocation, factors influencing the trans-sarcolemmal glucose concentration gradient might also be important. With regard to the interstitial glucose concentration microvascular perfusion is particular relevant as correlative evidence supports a connection between insulin sensitivity and microvascular perfusion. Thus, there are new candidates at several levels which collectively might explain the phenomenon.},

@article{Thompson-2012,
	abstract = { Physical activity and exercise are key components of energy expenditure and therefore of energy balance. Changes in energy balance alter fat mass. It is therefore reasonable to ask: What are the links between physical activity and adipose tissue function? There are many complexities. Physical activity is a multifaceted behavior of which exercise is just one component. Physical activity influences adipose tissue both acutely and in the longer term. A single bout of exercise stimulates adipose tissue blood flow and fat mobilization, resulting in delivery of fatty acids to skeletal muscles at a rate well-matched to metabolic requirements, except perhaps in vigorous intensity exercise. The stimuli include adrenergic and other circulating factors. There is a period following an exercise bout when fatty acids are directed away from adipose tissue to other tissues such as skeletal muscle, reducing dietary fat storage in adipose. With chronic exercise (training), there are changes in adipose tissue physiology, particularly an enhanced fat mobilization during acute exercise. It is difficult, however, to distinguish chronic ``structural'' changes from those associated with the last exercise bout. In addition, it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of training per se and negative energy balance. Epidemiological observations support the idea that physically active people have relatively low fat mass, and intervention studies tend to show that exercise training reduces fat mass. A much-discussed effect of exercise versus calorie restriction in preferentially reducing visceral fat is not borne out by meta-analyses. We conclude that, in addition to the regulation of fat mass, physical activity may contribute to metabolic health through beneficial dynamic changes within adipose tissue in response to each activity bout. },

	abstract = {{Endogenous triacylglycerols represent an important source of fuel for endurance exercise. Triacylglycerol oxidation increases progressively during exercise; the specific rate is determined by energy requirements of working muscles, fatty acid delivery to muscle mitochondria, and the oxidation of other substrates. The catecholamine response to exercise increases lipolysis of adipose tissue triacylglycerols and, presumably, intramuscular triacylglycerols. In addition, increases in adipose tissue and muscle blood flow decrease fatty acid reesterification and facilitate the delivery of released fatty acids to skeletal muscle. Alterations in fatty acid mobilization and the relative use of adipose and intramuscular triacylglycerols during exercise depend, in large part, on degree of fitness and exercise intensity. Compared with untrained persons exercising at the same absolute intensity, persons who have undergone endurance training have greater fat oxidation during exercise without increased lipolysis. Available evidence suggests that the training-induced increase in fat oxidation is due primarily to increased oxidation of non-plasma-derived fatty acids, perhaps from intramuscular triacylglycerol stores. Fat oxidation is lower in high-intensity exercise than in moderate-intensity exercise, in part because of decreased fatty acid delivery to exercising muscles. Parenteral lipid supplementation during high-intensity exercise increases fat oxidation, but the effect of ingesting long-chain or medium-chain triacylglycerols on substrate metabolism during exercise is less clear. This review discusses the relation between fatty acid mobilization and oxidation during exercise and the effect of endurance training, exercise intensity, and lipid supplementation on these responses.}},

The size of these glycogen stores plays a major role in determining how long vigorous endurance exercise can be performed if other causes of fatigue, such as dehydration or heat exhaustion, are avoided. In a ``fight or flight'' situation, individuals whose muscles are glycogen depleted are helpless, as they are unable to either run or fight. The same is true of someone who has become markedly hypoglycemic as a result of liver glycogen depletion. },

	abstract = {Ketone bodies become major body fuels during fasting and consumption of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet. Hyperketonemia is associated with potential health benefits. Ketone body synthesis (ketogenesis) is the last recognizable step of lipid energy metabolism, a pathway that links dietary lipids and adipose triglycerides to the Krebs cycle and respiratory chain and has three highly regulated control points: (1) adipocyte lipolysis, (2) mitochondrial fatty acids entry, controlled by the inhibition of carnitine palmityl transferase I by malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) and (3) mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase, which catalyzes the irreversible first step of ketone body synthesis. Each step is suppressed by an elevated circulating insulin level or insulin/glucagon ratio. The utilization of ketone bodies (ketolysis) also determines circulating ketone body levels. Consideration of ketone body metabolism reveals the mechanisms underlying the extreme fragility of dietary ketosis to carbohydrate intake and highlights areas for further study.},

	abstract = {The ketone bodies (KBs) D-3-hydroxybutyrate (D-3HB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) play a role in starvation and have been associated with insulin resistance. The dose--response relationship between insulin and KBs was demonstrated to be shifted to the right in type 2 diabetes patients. However, KB levels have also been reported to be decreased in obesity. We investigated the metabolic adaptation to fasting with respect to glucose and KB metabolism in lean and obese men without type 2 diabetes using stable glucose and D-3HB isotopes in a two-step pancreatic clamp after 38 h of fasting. We found that D-3HB fluxes in the basal state were higher in lean compared to obese men: 15.2 (10.7--27.1) vs. 7.0 (3.5--15.1) µmol/kg lean body mass (LBM)·min, respectively, P < 0.01. No differences were found in KB fluxes between lean and obese volunteers during the pancreatic clamp (step 1: 6.9 (1.8--12.0) vs. 7.4 (4.2--17.8) µmol/kg LBM·min, respectively; and step 2: 2.9 (0--7.2) vs. 3.4 (0.85--18.7) µmol/kg LBM·min, respectively), despite similar plasma insulin levels. Meanwhile, peripheral glucose uptake was higher in lean compared to obese men (step 1: 15.2 (12.3--25.6) vs. 14.7 (11.9--22.7) µmol/kg LBM·min, respectively, P ≤ 0.05; and step 2: 12.5 (7.0--17.3) vs. 10.8 (5.2--15.0) µmol/kg LBM·min, respectively, P ≤ 0.01). These data show that obese subjects who display insulin resistance on insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake have the same sensitivity for the insulin-mediated suppression of ketogenesis. This implies differential insulin sensitivity of intermediary metabolism in obesity.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an expanding global health problem, closely linked to the epidemic of obesity. Individuals with T2DM are at high risk for both microvascular complications (including retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular complications (such as cardiovascular comorbidities), owing to hyperglycaemia and individual components of the insulin resistance (metabolic) syndrome. Environmental factors (for example, obesity, an unhealthy diet and physical inactivity) and genetic factors contribute to the multiple pathophysiological disturbances that are responsible for impaired glucose homeostasis in T2DM. Insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion remain the core defects in T2DM, but at least six other pathophysiological abnormalities contribute to the dysregulation of glucose metabolism. The multiple pathogenetic disturbances present in T2DM dictate that multiple antidiabetic agents, used in combination, will be required to maintain normoglycaemia. The treatment must not only be effective and safe but also improve the quality of life. Several novel medications are in development, but the greatest need is for agents that enhance insulin sensitivity, halt the progressive pancreatic β-cell failure that is characteristic of T2DM and prevent or reverse the microvascular complications.

@article{Pociot-2016,
	abstract = {Summary
Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed at the end of a prodrome of β-cell autoimmunity. The disease is most likely triggered at an early age by autoantibodies primarily directed against insulin or glutamic acid decarboxylase, or both, but rarely against islet antigen-2. After the initial appearance of one of these autoantibody biomarkers, a second, third, or fourth autoantibody against either islet antigen-2 or the ZnT8 transporter might also appear. The larger the number of β-cell autoantibody types, the greater the risk of rapid progression to clinical onset of diabetes. This association does not necessarily mean that the β-cell autoantibodies are pathogenic, but rather that they represent reproducible biomarkers of the pathogenesis. The primary risk factor for β-cell autoimmunity is genetic, mainly occurring in individuals with either HLA-DR3-DQ2 or HLA-DR4-DQ8 haplotypes, or both, but a trigger from the environment is generally needed. The pathogenesis can be divided into three stages: 1, appearance of β-cell autoimmunity, normoglycaemia, and no symptoms; 2, β-cell autoimmunity, dysglycaemia, and no symptoms; and 3, β-cell autoimmunity, dysglycaemia, and symptoms of diabetes. The genetic association with each one of the three stages can differ. Type 1 diabetes could serve as a disease model for organ-specific autoimmune disorders such as coeliac disease, thyroiditis, and Addison's disease, which show similar early markers of a prolonged disease process before clinical diagnosis.},

@article{Leto-2012,
	abstract = {The glucose transporter GLUT4 facilitates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue. Defects in glucose uptake represent an early step in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.GLUT4 is distributed between the plasma membrane, the trans-Golgi network (TGN), endosomes and small heterogeneous vesicles that consist of sorting intermediates of the endosomal system and GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs). Treatment of muscle or adipose cells with insulin stimulates exocytosis of GLUT4 from multiple intracellular compartments, which results in increased GLUT4 levels at the plasma membrane for shuttling of glucose into the cell.In the absence of insulin, at least 50{\%} of GLUT4 is sequestered in specialized immobile GSVs. Stimulation with insulin results in regulated exocytosis of GSVs.GSV mobilization, targeting and fusion at the plasma membrane requires coordinated control of the trafficking machinery by insulin. Trafficking proteins that are regulated by insulin include multiple small GTPases of the RAB, RAL and RHO families, molecular motor proteins, the exocyst complex and SNARE regulatory proteins.Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) studies performed in live adipocytes have helped to elucidate the mechanisms by which insulin regulates specific trafficking proteins during GLUT4 exocytosis.},

Significant new developments in eukaryotic glycogen metabolism over the last decade or so include: (i) three-dimensional structures of the biosynthetic enzymes glycogenin and glycogen synthase, with associated implications for mechanism and control; (ii) analyses of several genetically engineered mice with altered glycogen metabolism that shed light on the mechanism of control; (iii) greater appreciation of the spatial aspects of glycogen metabolism, including more focus on the lysosomal degradation of glycogen; and (iv) glycogen phosphorylation and advances in the study of Lafora disease, which is emerging as a glycogen storage disease.}},

	abstract = {We have been interested in the metabolic effects of ingested fuels, both in normal subjects and in people with type 2 diabetes. Recently, we have become interested in the regulation of glucose production and the regulation of gluconeogenesis in particular. We are not aware of a recent comprehensive review of these topics. Therefore, we have reviewed the currently available literature. The pertinent papers obtained from a Medline search of the words gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, hepatic glucose output, as well as papers from our personal files, form the basis of this review. In order to analyse the data, it also was necessary to review the relevant methodology used in determining gluconeogenesis. Pathway diagrams have been included with this review in order to illustrate and highlight key aspects of the methodologies. Current data support the hypothesis that the rate of glucose appearance changes but the rate of gluconeogenesis remains remarkably stable in widely varying metabolic conditions in people without diabetes. In people with diabetes, whether gluconeogenesis remains unchanged is at present uncertain. Available data are very limited. The mechanism by which gluconeogenesis remains relatively constant, even in the setting of excess substrates, is not known. One interesting speculation is that gluconeogenic substrates substitute for each other depending on availability. Thus, the overall rate is either unaffected or only modestly changed. This requires further confirmation.},

A dual requirement for CREB phosphorylation and CRTC dephosphorylation is likely to explain how these activator-co-activator cognates discriminate between different stimuli.

It is a multicomponent system located in the endoplasmic reticulum that comprises several integral membrane proteins, namely a catalytic subunit (G6PC) and transporters for G6P, inorganic phosphate, and glucose. The G6PC gene family contains three members, designated G6PC, G6PC2, and G6PC3. The tissue-specific expression patterns of these genes differ, and mutations in all three genes have been linked to distinct diseases in humans. This minireview discusses the disease association and transcriptional regulation of the G6PC genes as well as the biological functions of the encoded proteins.},

	abstract = { ABSTRACTTranscription of the gene for PEPCK-C occurs in a number of mammalian tissues, with highest expression occurring in the liver, kidney cortex, and white and brown adipose tissue. Several hormones and other factors, including glucagon, epinephrine, insulin, glucocorticoids and metabolic acidosis, control this process in three responsive tissues, liver, adipose tissue, and kidney cortex. Expression of the gene in these three tissues in regulated in a different manner, responding to the specific physiological role of the tissue. The PEPCK-C gene promoter has been extensively studied and a number of regulatory regions identified that bind key transcription factors and render the gene responsive to hormonal and dietary stimuli. This review will focus on the control of transcription for the gene, with special emphasis on our current understanding of the transcription factors that are involved in the response of PEPCK-C gene in specific tissues. We have also reviewed the biological function of PEPCK-C in each of the tissues discussed in this review, in order to place the control of PEPCK-C gene transcription in the appropriate physiological context. Because of its extraordinary importance in mammalian metabolism and its broad pattern of tissue-specific expression, the PEPCK-C gene has become a model for studying the biological basis of the control of gene transcription },

@article{Rider-2004,
	abstract = {Fru-2,6-P2 (fructose 2,6-bisphosphate) is a signal molecule that controls glycolysis. Since its discovery more than 20 years ago, inroads have been made towards the understanding of the structure-function relationships in PFK-2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase)/FBPase-2 (fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase), the homodimeric bifunctional enzyme that catalyses the synthesis and degradation of Fru-2,6-P2. The FBPase-2 domain of the enzyme subunit bears sequence, mechanistic and structural similarity to the histidine phosphatase family of enzymes. The PFK-2 domain was originally thought to resemble bacterial PFK-1 (6-phosphofructo-1-kinase), but this proved not to be correct. Molecular modelling of the PFK-2 domain revealed that, instead, it has the same fold as adenylate kinase. This was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. A PFK-2/FBPase-2 sequence in the genome of one prokaryote, the proteobacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, could be the result of horizontal gene transfer from a eukaryote distantly related to all other organisms, possibly a protist. This, together with the presence of PFK-2/FBPase-2 genes in trypanosomatids (albeit with possibly only one of the domains active), indicates that fusion of genes initially coding for separate PFK-2 and FBPase-2 domains might have occurred early in evolution. In the enzyme homodimer, the PFK-2 domains come together in a head-to-head like fashion, whereas the FBPase-2 domains can function as monomers. There are four PFK-2/FBPase-2 isoenzymes in mammals, each coded by a different gene that expresses several isoforms of each isoenzyme. In these genes, regulatory sequences have been identified which account for their long-term control by hormones and tissue-specific transcription factors. One of these, HNF-6 (hepatocyte nuclear factor-6), was discovered in this way. As to short-term control, the liver isoenzyme is phosphorylated at the N-terminus, adjacent to the PFK-2 domain, by PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase), leading to PFK-2 inactivation and FBPase-2 activation. In contrast, the heart isoenzyme is phosphorylated at the C-terminus by several protein kinases in different signalling pathways, resulting in PFK-2 activation.},

Recently, crystal structures of CPT-2 were determined in uninhibited forms and in complexes with inhibitory substrate-analogs with anti-diabetic properties in animal models and in clinical studies. The CPT-2 crystal structures have advanced understanding of CPT structure-function relationships and will facilitate discovery of novel inhibitors by structure-based drug design.

@article{Thomson-2009,
	abstract = {AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has emerged as a key regulator of skeletal muscle fat metabolism. Because abnormalities in skeletal muscle metabolism contribute to a variety of clinical diseases and disorders, understanding AMPK's role in the muscle is important. It was originally shown to stimulate fatty acid (FA) oxidation decades ago, and since then much research has been accomplished describing this role. In this brief review, we summarize much of these data, particularly in relation to changes in FA oxidation that occur during skeletal muscle exercise. Potential roles for AMPK exist in regulating FA transport into the mitochondria via interactions with acetyl-CoA carboxylase, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, and perhaps FA transporter/CD36 (FAT/CD36). Likewise, AMPK may regulate transport of FAs into the cell through FAT/CD36. AMPK may also regulate capacity for FA oxidation by phosphorylation of transcription factors such as CREB or coactivators such as PGC-1alpha.},

	abstract = {Ketone bodies become major body fuels during fasting and consumption of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet. Hyperketonemia is associated with potential health benefits. Ketone body synthesis (ketogenesis) is the last recognizable step of lipid energy metabolism, a pathway that links dietary lipids and adipose triglycerides to the Krebs cycle and respiratory chain and has three highly regulated control points: (1) adipocyte lipolysis, (2) mitochondrial fatty acids entry, controlled by the inhibition of carnitine palmityl transferase I by malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) and (3) mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase, which catalyzes the irreversible first step of ketone body synthesis. Each step is suppressed by an elevated circulating insulin level or insulin/glucagon ratio. The utilization of ketone bodies (ketolysis) also determines circulating ketone body levels. Consideration of ketone body metabolism reveals the mechanisms underlying the extreme fragility of dietary ketosis to carbohydrate intake and highlights areas for further study.},

	abstract = { Malonyl-CoA can be formed within the mitochondria, peroxisomes, and cytosol of mammalian cells. Besides being an intermediate in the pathways of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and fatty acid elongation, malonyl-CoA has an important signaling function through its allosteric inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, the enzyme that normally exerts flux control over mitochondrial β-oxidation. Malonyl-CoA is rapidly turned over in mammalian cells, and the activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase are important determinants of its cytosolic concentration. It is now recognized that malonyl-CoA participates in a diverse range of physiological or pathological responses and systems. These include the ketogenic response of the liver to fasting and diabetes, carbohydrate versus fat fuel selection in muscle tissues, metabolic changes in muscle during contracture, alterations in fatty acid metabolism during cardiac ischemia and postischemic reperfusion, stimulation of B cell insulin secretion by glucose, and the hypothalamic control of appetite. },

	abstract = { The human organism has tools to cope with metabolic challenges like starvation that are crucial for survival. Lipolysis, lipid oxidation, ketone body synthesis, tailored endogenous glucose production and uptake, and decreased glucose oxidation serve to protect against excessive erosion of protein mass, which is the predominant supplier of carbon chains for synthesis of newly formed glucose. The starvation response shows that the adaptation to energy deficit is very effective and coordinated with different adaptations in different organs. From an evolutionary perspective, this lipid-induced effect on glucose oxidation and uptake is very strong and may therefore help to understand why insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus is difficult to treat. The importance of reciprocity in lipid and glucose metabolism during human starvation should be taken into account when studying lipid and glucose metabolism in general and in pathophysiological conditions in particular. },

	abstract = { In 1963, Lancet published a paper by Randle et al. that proposed a ``glucose-fatty acid cycle'' to describe fuel flux between and fuel selection by tissues. The original biochemical mechanism explained the inhibition of glucose oxidation by fatty acids. Since then, the principle has been confirmed by many investigators. At the same time, many new mechanisms controlling the utilization of glucose and fatty acids have been discovered. Here, we review the known short- and long-term mechanisms involved in the control of glucose and fatty acid utilization at the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial level in mammalian muscle and liver under normal and pathophysiological conditions. They include allosteric control, reversible phosphorylation, and the expression of key enzymes. However, the complexity is formidable. We suggest that not all chapters of the Randle cycle have been written. },

Here we review new developments in the regulation of the activities and expression of the PDKs, in particular PDK2 and PDK4, in relation to glucose and lipid homeostasis. This review describes recent advances relating to the acute and long-term modes of regulation of the PDKs, with particular emphasis on the regulatory roles of nuclear receptors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and Liver X receptor (LXR), PPAR γ coactivator α (PGC-1α) and insulin, and the impact of changes in PDK activity and expression in glucose and lipid homeostasis. Since PDK4 may assist in lipid clearance when there is an imbalance between lipid delivery and oxidation, it may represent an attractive target for interventions aimed at rectifying abnormal lipid as well as glucose homeostasis in disease states. },

@article{Holness-2003,
	abstract = {{PDC (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) catalyses the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, linking glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Regulation of PDC determines and reflects substrate preference and is critical to the `glucose--fatty acid cycle', a concept of reciprocal regulation of lipid and glucose oxidation to maintain glucose homoeostasis developed by Philip Randle. Mammalian PDC activity is inactivated by phosphorylation by the PDKs (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases). PDK inhibition by pyruvate facilitates PDC activation, favouring glucose oxidation and malonyl-CoA formation: the latter suppresses LCFA (long-chain fatty acid) oxidation. PDK activation by the high mitochondrial acetyl-CoA/CoA and NADH/NAD+ concentration ratios that reflect high rates of LCFA oxidation causes blockade of glucose oxidation. Complementing glucose homoeostasis in health, fuel allostasis, i.e. adaptation to maintain homoeostasis, is an essential component of the response to chronic changes in glycaemia and lipidaemia in insulin resistance. We develop the concept that the PDKs act as tissue homoeostats and suggest that long-term modulation of expression of individual PDKs, particularly PDK4, is an essential component of allostasis to maintain homoeostasis. We also describe the intracellular signals that govern the expression of the various PDK isoforms, including the roles of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and lipids, as effectors within the context of allostasis.}},

@article{Randle-1998,
	abstract = {Competition for respiration between substrates in animal tissues has been known for at least 80 years. The most important interaction, quantitatively is between glucose and fatty acids. The starting point in 1963 for the so called Glucose Fatty Acid Cycle was the realisation that the metabolic relationship between glucose and fatty acids is reciprocal and not dependent. Glucose provision promotes glucose oxidation and glucose and lipid storage, and inhibits fatty acid oxidation. Provision of free fatty acids promotes fatty acid oxidation and storage, inhibits glucose oxidation and may promote glucose storage if glycogen reserves are incomplete. This review is concerned predominantly with evidence in man in vivo. In the authors opinion the evidence for inhibitory effects of fatty acids on whole body glucose utilization ad oxidation (predominantly muscles) is decisive and enzyme mechanisms mediating these effects are well established. There is also much evidence that fatty acid oxidation inhibits glucose oxidation and stimulates glucose formation in liver and again enzyme mechanism are known. A permissive role for fatty acids in the insulin secretory response of islet beta-cells has now been firmly established and can be visualised as a mechanism to protect continuing provision of respiratory substrate. Longer term exposure of islet beta-cells to fatty acids impairs the insulin secretory response to glucose and mechanisms are known. There is compelling evidence that fatty acid oxidation may impair glucose oxidation in uncontrolled Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, but no convincing evidence that fatty acids have a role in diminished glucose storage (glycogen deposition) in Type 2 diabetes. The inhibition of glucose storage which may follow prolonged elevation of plasma FFA in man and experimental animals is associated with glycogen repletion whereas the inhibition of glucose storage in Type 2 diabetes is associated with glycogen depletion. The precise role of fatty acids in disturbed carbohydrate metabolism in Type 2 diabetes is an area where future progress is confidently predicted.},

@article{Lass-2011,
	abstract = {Summary Lipolysis is the biochemical pathway responsible for the catabolism of triacylglycerol (TAG) stored in cellular lipid droplets. The hydrolytic cleavage of TAG generates non-esterified fatty acids, which are subsequently used as energy substrates, essential precursors for lipid and membrane synthesis, or mediators in cell signaling processes. Consistent with its central importance in lipid and energy homeostasis, lipolysis occurs in essentially all tissues and cell types, it is most abundant, however, in white and brown adipose tissue. Over the last 5years, important enzymes and regulatory protein factors involved in lipolysis have been identified. These include an essential TAG hydrolase named adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) [annotated as patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein A2], the ATGL activator comparative gene identification-58 [annotated as α/β hydrolase containing protein 5], and the ATGL inhibitor G0/G1 switch gene 2. Together with the established hormone-sensitive lipase [annotated as lipase E] and monoglyceride lipase, these proteins constitute the basic ``lipolytic machinery''. Additionally, a large number of hormonal signaling pathways and lipid droplet-associated protein factors regulate substrate access and the activity of the ``lipolysome''. This review summarizes the current knowledge concerning the enzymes and regulatory processes governing lipolysis of fat stores in adipose and non-adipose tissues. Special emphasis will be given to ATGL, its regulation, and physiological function.},

Adipose tissue mass and the mechanisms that control it are central to elucidating the aetiology of obesity and insulin resistance. Over the past 15 years tremendous progress has been made in several avenues relating to adipose tissue. Knowledge of the lipolytic machinery has grown with the identification of new lipases, cofactors and interactions between proteins and lipids that are central to the regulation of basal and stimulated lipolysis. The dated idea of an inert lipid droplet has been appropriately revamped to that of a dynamic and highly-structured organelle that in itself offers regulatory control over lipolysis. The present review provides an overview of the numerous partners and pathways involved in adipose tissue lipolysis and their interaction under various metabolic states. Integration of these findings into whole adipose tissue metabolism and its systemic effects is also presented in the context of inflammation and insulin resistance.},

Here we describe the features and mutational landscape of DNA damage caused by acetaldehyde, an endogenous and alcohol-derived metabolite. This damage results in DNA double-stranded breaks that, despite stimulating recombination repair, also cause chromosome rearrangements. We combined transplantation of single haematopoietic stem cells with whole-genome sequencing to show that this damage occurs in stem cells, leading to deletions and rearrangements that are indicative of microhomology-mediated end-joining repair. Moreover, deletion of p53 completely rescues the survival of aldehyde-stressed and mutated haematopoietic stem cells, but does not change the pattern or the intensity of genome instability within individual stem cells. These findings characterize the mutation of the stem-cell genome by an alcohol-derived and endogenous source of DNA damage. Furthermore, we identify how the choice of DNA-repair pathway and a stringent p53 response limit the transmission of aldehyde-induced mutations in stem cells.},

@article{Haag-2014,
	abstract = {Author Summary Abnormal signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) contributes to the development of various human diseases, including different cancer types. One important mechanism that controls intracellular signal transduction is by regulation of the subcellular receptor localization in the signal-receiving cell. We are investigating the regulation of the EGFR homolog LET-23 in the Nematode C. elegans by observing the localization of the EGFR in the epithelial cells of live animals. This approach has allowed us to study the dynamics of receptor trafficking in cells embedded in their natural environment and receiving physiological concentrations of various extracellular signals. In a systematic RNA interference screen, we have identified 81 genes controlling EGFR localization and signaling in different subcellular compartments. One new regulator of EGFR signaling identified in this screen encodes the Ezrin Homolog ERM-1. We show genetic and biochemical evidence indicating that ERM-1 is part of a buffering mechanism to maintain a pool of immobile EGFR in the basolateral membrane compartment of the epithelial cells. This mechanism permits the generation of a long-lasting EGFR signal during multiple rounds of cell divisions. The control of receptor localization is thus necessary for the precise temporal regulation of signal transduction during animal development.},

	abstract = {In C. elegans, the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase is localized to the basolateral membranes of polarized vulval epithelial cells. lin-2, lin-7, and lin-10 are required for basolateral localization of LET-23, since LET-23 is mislocalized to the apical membrane in lin-2, lin-7, and lin-10 mutants. Yeast two-hybrid, in vitro binding, and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation experiments show that LIN-2, LIN-7, and LIN-10 form a protein complex. Furthermore, compensatory mutations in lin-7 and let-23 exhibit allele-specific suppression of apical mislocalization and signaling-defective phenotypes. These results present a mechanism for basolateral localization of LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase by direct binding to the LIN-2/LIN-7/LIN-10 complex. Each of the binding interactions within this complex is conserved, suggesting that this complex may also mediate basolateral localization in mammals.},

	abstract = {How cells in developing organisms interpret the quantitative information contained in morphogen gradients is an open question. Here we address this question using a novel integrative approach that combines quantitative measurements of morphogen-induced gene expression at single-mRNA resolution with mathematical modelling of the induction process. We focus on the induction of Notch ligands by the LIN-3/EGF morphogen gradient during vulva induction in Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that LIN-3/EGF-induced Notch ligand expression is highly dynamic, exhibiting an abrupt transition from low to high expression. Similar transitions in Notch ligand expression are observed in two highly divergent wild C. elegans isolates. Mathematical modelling and experiments show that this transition is driven by a dynamic increase in the sensitivity of the induced cells to external LIN-3/EGF. Furthermore, this increase in sensitivity is independent of the presence of LIN-3/EGF. Our integrative approach might be useful to study induction by morphogen gradients in other systems.},

	abstract = {During development of the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite, the gonadal anchor cell induces nearby Pn.p cells to adopt vulval fates. The response to this signal is mediated by a receptor tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathway that has been remarkably well conserved during metazoan evolution. Because mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are activated by receptor tyrosine kinase pathways in vertebrate cells, we hypothesized that C. elegans MAP kinase homologs may play a role in vulval induction. Two C. elegans MAP kinase genes, mpk-1 and mpk-2 (mpk, MAP kinase), were cloned using degenerate oligonucleotide primers and PCR amplification; in parallel, genes involved in vulval induction were identified by screening for mutations that suppress the vulval defects caused by an activated let-60 ras gene. One such suppressor mutation is an allele of mpk-1. We used a new type of mosaic analysis to show that mpk-1 acts cell autonomously in the Pn.p cells. Our results show that mpk-1 plays an important functional role as an activator in ras-mediated cell signaling in vivo.},

	abstract = {An evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway that utilizes a receptor tyrosine kinase and a Ras protein mediates the induction of vulval cell fates in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We sought new genes that function in this pathway by screening for suppressors of the Multivulva phenotype caused by a mutation that activates the let-60 ras gene. Seven such suppressor mutations defined a new gene involved in vulval induction. We named this gene mek-2, because its predicted protein product is most similar to MEK, a protein-serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase. mek-2 mutations can be arranged in an allelic series. A probable null mutation eliminated vulval induction, and the strongest mutations alter codons conserved in most or all protein kinases. Our genetic analysis showed that mek-2 functions downstream of let-60 ras and is required for ras-mediated signal transduction in vivo. The MEK-2 protein may interact with the products of the lin-45 raf and mpk-1 MAP kinase genes, which also mediate vulval induction.},

	abstract = {Each of the six C. elegans vulval precursor cells (VPCs) has three potential fates (1$\,^{\circ}$, 2$\,^{\circ}$, or 3$\,^{\circ}$). The fate of each VPC depends on two types of signals: a graded inductive signal that acts at a distance and a short-range lateral signal among the VPCs. We describe interactions among mutations that cause different misspecifications of VPC fates. Particular combinations of mutations cause all six VPCs to have a single fate independent of their positions. Our results suggest that specification of the three VPC fates is accomplished by two binary decisions, each effected by one of the two signaling pathways. The gene lin-12 acts in the lateral signaling pathway and specifies 2$\,^{\circ}$. The ``vulvaless'' and ``multivulva'' genes act in the inductive signaling pathway and specify 1$\,^{\circ}$ independently of lin-12 and 2$\,^{\circ}$ via lin-12. We describe a model for the regulatory circuitry underlying VPC determination that includes a role for lin-12 in both autocrine and paracrine VPC signaling.},

DEP-1 amplifies in the developing vulva and the excretory system the small differences in the amount of EGF signal received by equivalent precursor cells to achieve binary cell fate decisions. During vulval development, DEP-1 inhibits EGFR signaling in the secondary cell lineage in parallel with the NOTCH-mediated lateral inhibition, while EGFR signaling simultaneously down-regulates DEP-1 and NOTCH expression in the primary cell lineage. This regulatory network of inhibitors results in the full activation of the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway in the primary vulval cells and at the same time keeps the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway inactive in the adjacent secondary cells. Mammalian Dep-1/Scc1 functions as a tumor-suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium. Thus, mutations in human Dep-1 may promote tumor formation through a hyperactivation of the EGF receptor.},

	abstract = {The LIN-1 ETS transcription factor inhibits vulval cell fates during Caenorhabditis elegans development. We demonstrate that LIN-1 interacts with UBC-9, a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) conjugating enzyme. This interaction is mediated by two consensus sumoylation motifs in LIN-1. Biochemical studies showed that LIN-1 is covalently modified by SUMO-1. ubc-9 and smo-1, the gene encoding SUMO-1, inhibit vulval cell fates and function at the level of lin-1, indicating that sumoylation promotes LIN-1 inhibition of vulval cell fates. Sumoylation of LIN-1 promoted transcriptional repression and mediated an interaction with MEP-1, a protein previously shown to associate with the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) transcriptional repression complex. Genetic studies showed that mep-1 inhibits vulval cell fates and functions at the level of lin-1. We propose that sumoylation of LIN-1 mediates an interaction with MEP-1 that contributes to transcriptional repression of genes that promote vulval cell fates. These studies identify a molecular mechanism for SUMO-mediated transcriptional repression.},

	abstract = {The Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite vulva is one of the best studied models for signal transduction and cell fate determination during organogenesis. Systematic forward genetic screens have identified a complex and highly interconnected signaling network formed by the conserved EGFR, NOTCH, and WNT signaling pathways that specifies an invariant pattern of cell fates among the six vulval precursor cells (VPCs). Multiple inhibitory interactions between the EGFR and NOTCH pathways ensure the selection of a single 1$\,^{\circ}$ VPC that is always flanked by two 2$\,^{\circ}$ VPCs thanks to lateral NOTCH signaling. Building on this `central dogma' of cell fate specification, scientists have investigated a broad spectrum of novel questions that are summarized in this review. For example, vulval development is a unique model to study the intracellular trafficking of signaling molecules, such as NOTCH or EGFR, to investigate the interactions between the cell cycle and cell fate specification pathways, and to observe epithelial tube morphogenesis and cell invasion at single-cell resolution. Finally, computer scientists have integrated the experimental data into mathematical and state-based `in silico' models of vulval development, allowing them to test the completeness and limits of our current understanding.},

	abstract = {Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated activation of the canonical Ras/MAPK signaling cascade is responsible for cell proliferation and cell growth. This signaling pathway is frequently overactivated in epithelial cancers; therefore, studying regulation of this pathway is crucial not only for our fundamental understanding of cell biology but also for our ability to treat EGFR-related disease. Genetic model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans, a hermaphroditic nematode, played a vital role in identifying components of the EGFR/Ras/MAPK pathway and delineating their order of function, and continues to play a role in identifying novel regulators of the pathway. Polarized activation of LET-23, the C. elegans homolog of EGFR, is responsible for induction of the vulval cell fate; perturbations in this signaling pathway produce either a vulvaless or multivulva phenotype. The translucent cuticle of the nematode facilitates in vivo visualization of the receptor, revealing that localization of LET-23 EGFR is tightly regulated and linked to its function. In this chapter, we review the methods used to harness vulva development as a tool for studying EGFR signaling and trafficking in C. elegans.},

Recessive let-60 mutations that cause a vulvaless phenotype prevent let-60 function in response to the inductive signal. These mutations are clustered and define regions necessary either for the activation or for the action of the let-60 ras protein. Dominant let-60 mutations that cause a multivulva phenotype alter codon 13 and activate let-60 in vivo, rendering it independent of the inductive signal. The let-60 gene acts within an extensively defined genetic pathway, and other genes within this pathway seem likely to encode molecules that regulate let-60 function as well as molecules that are targets of let-60 action.},

By analyzing a newly isolated mutant (dig-1) that displaces the gonad, we discovered that cell interactions coordinate the spatial relationships among the different components of the egg-laying system. First, the gonad induces the formation of the vulva, and vulval induction by dorsal gonads strongly suggests that the inductive signal can act at a distance. Second, the gonad acts at a distance to regulate the migrations of the sex myoblasts that generate the egg-laying musculature. Third, the positions of the axonal branch and synapses of each HSN neuron are displaced correspondingly with the rest of the egg-laying system in dig-1 animals, which suggests that cell interactions also control aspects of HSN development.},

	abstract = {Abnormal activation of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway has been described in a wide variety of human cancers and in cancer stem cells (CSCs), however, the role of SHH pathway in gastric CSCs has not been reported. In this study, we investigated the possibility that abnormal activation of the SHH pathway maintained the characteristics of gastric CSCs. First, we identified cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) from human gastric cancer cell lines (HGC-27, MGC-803 and MKN-45) using tumorsphere culture. Compared with adherent cells, the floating tumorsphere cells had more self-renewing capacity and chemoresistance. The cells expressing CSCs markers (CD44, CD24 and CD133) were also significantly more in tumorsphere cells than in adherent cells. More importantly, in vivo xenograft studies showed that tumors could be generated with 2×104 tumorsphere cells, which was 100-fold less than those required for tumors seeding by adherent cells. Next, RT-PCR and Western blot showed that the expression levels of Ptch and Gli1 (SHH pathway target genes) were significantly higher in tumorsphere cells than in adherent cells. The results of quantitative real-time PCR were similar to those of RT-PCR and Western blot. Further analysis revealed that SHH pathway blocked by cyclopamine or 5E1 caused a higher reduction in self-renewing capacity of HGC-27 tumorsphere cells than that of adherent cells. We also found that SHH pathway blocking strongly enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs in HGC-27 tumorsphere cells in vitro and in vivo but had no significant effect in adherent cells. Finally, we isolated the tumorspheres from gastric cancer specimen, these cells also had chemoresistance and tumorigenic capacity, and SHH pathway maintained the gastric CSLCs characteristics of tumorsphere cells from primary tumor samples. In conclusion, our data suggested that SHH pathway was essential for maintenance of CSLCs in human gastric cancer.},

	abstract = {In this decade, great progress has been made in the field of organ regeneration by incorporating emerging concepts from the fields of stem cell biology and developmental biology, and this progress has pioneered a new frontier in regenerative medicine. The generation of bioengineered organ germ-utilizing, fate-determined, organ-inductive epithelial and mesenchymal cells has provided evidence for the concept of functional organ regeneration in vivo. Organoid studies have verified that nearly all organs can be generated in the form of a mini-organ by recapitulating embryonic body patterning and establishing an organ-forming field among self-organizing pluripotent stem cells by utilizing cytokines that mimic the patterning and positional signals of organogenesis. More recently, the regeneration of an integumentary organ system composed of multiple organs, including hair follicles, has been achieved, demonstrating that regenerative medicine is forthcoming. In this review, we will introduce current research trends aimed at regenerating a functional three-dimensional (3D) organ, and we will discuss the potential use of these recent achievements and future directions needed to realize the next-generation of regenerative therapy for organ replacement.},

	abstract = {The response of host organisms (including at the protein and cellular level) to nanomaterials is different than that observed to conventional materials. Nanomaterials are those materials which possess constituents less than 100nm in at least one direction. This review will first introduce the use of nanomaterials in a variety of implant applications highlighting their promise towards regenerating tissues. Such reviewed studies will emphasize interactions of nanomaterials with various proteins and subsequently cells. Moreover, such advances in the use of nanomaterials as novel implants have been largely, to date, determined by conventional methods. However, the novel structure--property relationships unique for nanosized materials reside at the nanoscale. That is, the novelty of a nanomaterial can only be fully appreciated by characterizing their interactions with biological systems (such as proteins) with nanoscale resolution analytical tools. This characterization of nanomaterials at the nanoscale is critical to understanding and, hence, further promoting increased tissue growth on nanomaterials. For this reason, while more tools are needed for this emerging field, this review will also cover currently available surface characterization techniques that emphasize nanoscale resolution pertinent for characterizing biological interactions with nanomaterials, including attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), colorimetric biological assays, circular dichroism (CD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Only through the coordination of nanoscale analytical tools with studies that highlight mechanisms of increased tissue growth on nanomaterials will we be able to design better implant materials.},

	abstract = {Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a powerful structural method allowing one to study the structure, folding state and flexibility of native particles and complexes in solution and to rapidly analyze structural changes in response to variations in external conditions. New high brilliance sources and novel data analysis methods significantly enhanced resolution and reliability of structural models provided by the technique. Automation of the SAXS experiment, data processing and interpretation make solution SAXS a streamline tool for large scale structural studies in molecular biology. The method provides low resolution macromolecular shapes ab initio and is readily combined with other structural and biochemical techniques in integrative studies. Very importantly, SAXS is sensitive to macromolecular flexibility being one of the few structural techniques applicable to flexible systems and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). A major recent development is the use of SAXS to study particle dynamics in solution by ensemble approaches, which allow one to quantitatively characterize flexible systems. Of special interest is the joint use of SAXS with solution NMR, given that both methods yield highly complementary structural information, in particular, for IDPs. In this chapter, we present the basics of SAXS and also consider protocols of the experiment and data analysis for different scenarios depending on the type of the studied object. These include ab initio shape reconstruction, validation of available high resolution structures and rigid body modelling for folded macromolecules and also characterisation of flexible proteins with the ensemble methods. The methods are illustrated by examples of recent applications and further perspectives of the integrative use of SAXS with NMR in the studies of IDPs are discussed.},

@article{Barrow-1992,
	abstract = {The A4 or β-peptide (39 to 43 amino acid residues) is the principal proteinaceous component of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease. Using circular dichroism (c.d.), we have studied the secondary structures and aggregational properties in solution of 4 synthetic amyloid β-peptides: β-(1--28), β-(1--39), β-(1--42) and β-(29--42). The natural components of cerebrovascular deposits and extracellular amyloid plaques are β-(1--39) and β-(1--42), while β-(1--28) and β-(29--42) are unnatural fragments. The β-(1--28), β-(1--39) and β-(1--42) peptides adopt mixtures of β-sheet, α-helix and random coil structures, with the relative proportions of each secondary structure being strongly dependent upon the solution conditions. In aqueous solution, β-sheet structure is favored for the β-(1--39) and β-(1--42) peptides, while in aqueous solution containing trifluoroethanol (TFE) or hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), α-helical structure is favored for all 3 peptides. The α-helical structure unfolds with increasing temperature and is favored at pH 1 to 4 and pH 7 to 10; the β-sheet conformation is temperature insensitive and is favored at pH 4 to 7. Peptide concentration studies showed that the β-sheet conformation is oligomeric (intermolecular), whereas the α-helical conformation is monomeric (intramolecular). The rate of aggregation to the oligomeric β-sheet structure (α-helix → random coil → β-sheet) is also dependent upon the solution conditions such as the pH and peptide concentration; maximum β-sheet formation occurs at pH 5.4. These results suggest that β-peptide is not an intrinsically insoluble peptide. Thus, solution abnormalities, together with localized high peptide concentrations, which may occur in Alzheimer's disease, may contribute to the formation of amyloid plaques. The hydrophobic β-(29--42) peptide adopts exclusively an intermolecular β-sheet conformation in aqueous solution despite changes in temperature or pH. Therefore, this segment may be the first region of the β-peptide to aggregate and may direct the folding of the complete β-peptide to produce the β-pleated sheet structure found in amyloid deposits. Differences between the solution conformations of the β-(1--39) and β-(1--42) peptides suggests that the last 3 C-terminal amino acids are crucial to amyloid deposition.},

Not only is this knowledge relevant to studies of biological function, it also facilitates determination of a protein structure using homogeneous monodisperse protein samples. A researcher faced with a new protein to study will have many questions even after that protein has been purified. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) can provide all of this information readily from a small sample in a non-destructive way, without the need for labeling, enabling structure determination experiments without any wasting time and material on uncharacterized samples. In this article, I use examples to illustrate how AUC can contribute to protein structural analysis. Integrating information from a variety of biophysical experimental methods, such as X-ray crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, AUC allows a more complete understanding of the structure and function of biomacromolecules.},

Development of more stable microscopes, improved direct electron detectors and faster software for image processing has enabled structural solution of not only large macromolecular (megadalton range) complexes but also small (~60 kDa) proteins. As a result of the widespread use of the technique, we have also witnessed new developments of techniques for cryo-EM grid preparation of membrane protein samples. This includes new types of solubilization strategies that better stabilize these protein complexes and the development of new grid supports with proven efficacy in reducing the motion of the molecules during electron beam exposure. Here, we discuss the practicalities and recent challenges of membrane protein sample preparation and vitrification, as well as grid support and foil treatment in the context of the structure determination of protein complexes by single particle cryo-EM.},

Aberrant cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) results in aggregation of amyloid-β, which accumulates in the brain and consequently causes Alzheimer's disease. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of an intact human γ-secretase complex at 4.5 {\AA}resolution, determined by cryo-electron-microscopy single-particle analysis. The γ-secretase complex comprises a horseshoe-shaped transmembrane domain, which contains 19 transmembrane segments (TMs), and a large extracellular domain (ECD) from nicastrin, which sits immediately above the hollow space formed by the TM horseshoe. Intriguingly, nicastrin ECD is structurally similar to a large family of peptidases exemplified by the glutamate carboxypeptidase PSMA. This structure serves as an important basis for understanding the functional mechanisms of the γ-secretase complex.},

Here we report an atomic structure of human γ-secretase at 3.4 {\AA}resolution, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Mutations derived from Alzheimer's disease affect residues at two hotspots in PS1, each located at the centre of a distinct four transmembrane segment (TM) bundle. TM2 and, to a lesser extent, TM6 exhibit considerable flexibility, yielding a plastic active site and adaptable surrounding elements. The active site of PS1 is accessible from the convex side of the TM horseshoe, suggesting considerable conformational changes in nicastrin extracellular domain after substrate recruitment. Component protein APH-1 serves as a scaffold, anchoring the lone transmembrane helix from nicastrin and supporting the flexible conformation of PS1. Ordered phospholipids stabilize the complex inside the membrane. Our structure serves as a molecular basis for mechanistic understanding of γ-secretase function.},

Initial successes in obtaining near-atomic resolution structures with cryo-EM were enabled to a large extent by advances in microscope and detector technology. Here, we review some of the complementary technical improvements that are helping sustain the cryo-EM revolution. We highlight advances in image processing that permit high resolution structure determination even in the presence of structural and conformational heterogeneity. We also review selected examples where biochemical strategies for membrane protein stabilization facilitate cryo-EM structure determination, and discuss emerging approaches for further improving the preparation of reliable plunge-frozen specimens.},

X-ray crystallography can utilize a low-resolution EM map for structure determination followed by phase extension to high resolution. Test studies have been conducted on five crystal structures of large molecular assemblies, in which EM maps are used as models for structure solution by molecular replacement (MR) using various standard MR packages such as {\it AMoRe}, {\it MOLREP} and {\it Phaser}. The results demonstrate that EM maps are viable models for molecular replacement. Possible difficulties in data analysis, such as the effects of the EM magnification error, and the effect of MR positional/rotational errors on phase extension are discussed.},

@article{Milne-2013,
	abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is increasingly becoming a mainstream technology for studying the architecture of cells, viruses and protein assemblies at molecular resolution. Recent developments in microscope design and imaging hardware, paired with enhanced image processing and automation capabilities, are poised to further advance the effectiveness of cryo-EM methods. These developments promise to increase the speed and extent of automation, and to improve the resolutions that may be achieved, making this technology useful to determine a wide variety of biological structures. Additionally, established modalities for structure determination, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are being routinely integrated with cryo-EM density maps to achieve atomic-resolution models of complex, dynamic molecular assemblies. In this review, which is directed towards readers who are not experts in cryo-EM methodology, we provide an overview of emerging themes in the application of this technology to investigate diverse questions in biology and medicine. We discuss the ways in which these methods are being used to study structures of macromolecular assemblies that range in size from whole cells to small proteins. Finally, we include a description of how the structural information obtained by cryo-EM is deposited and archived in a publicly accessible database.},

@article{Xiao-2016,
	abstract = {In most bacteria, cell division relies on the functions of an essential protein, FtsZ. FtsZ polymerizes at the future division site to form a ring-like structure, termed the Z-ring, that serves as a scaffold to recruit all other division proteins, and possibly generates force to constrict the cell. The scaffolding function of the Z-ring is well established, but the force generating function has recently been called into question. Additionally, new findings have demonstrated that the Z-ring is more directly linked to cell wall metabolism than simply recruiting enzymes to the division site. Here we review these advances and suggest that rather than generating a rate-limiting constrictive force, the Z-ring's function may be redefined as an orchestrator of septum synthesis.},

@article{Rodrigues-2012,
	abstract = {Author Summary How organisms regulate biological processes so that they occur at the correct place within the cell is a fundamental question in research. Spatial regulation of cell division is vital to ensure equal partitioning of DNA into newborn cells. Correct positioning of the division site at the cell centre in rod-shaped bacteria is generally believed to occur via the combined action of two factors: (i) nucleoid (chromosome) occlusion and (ii) a set of proteins known collectively as the Min system. The earliest stage in bacterial cell division is the assembly of a ring, called the Z ring, at the division site. Nucleoid occlusion and Min work by preventing Z ring assembly at all sites along the cell other than the cell centre. Here we make the surprising discovery that, in the absence of both these factors, Z rings are positioned correctly at the division site, but there is a delay in this process and it is less efficient. We propose that a separate mechanism identifies the division site at midcell in rod-shaped bacteria, and nucleoid occlusion and Min ensure that the Z ring forms there and only there, at the right time and every time.},

@article{Hale-1999,
	abstract = {Cell division in prokaryotes is mediated by the septal ring. In Escherichia coli, this organelle consists of several essential division proteins, including FtsZ, FtsA, and ZipA. To gain more insight into how the structure is assembled, we studied the interdependence of FtsZ, FtsA, and ZipA localization using both immunofluorescence and Gfp tagging techniques. To this end, we constructed a set of strains allowing us to determine the cellular location of each of these three proteins in cells from which one of the other two had been specifically depleted. Our results show that ZipA fails to accumulate in a ring shape in the absence of FtsZ. Conversely, depletion of ZipA does not abolish formation of FtsZ rings but leads to a significant reduction in the number of rings per unit of cell mass. In addition, ZipA does not appear to require FtsA for assembly into the septal ring and vice versa. It is suggested that septal ring formation starts by assembly of the FtsZ ring, after which ZipA and FtsA join this structure in a mutually independent fashion through direct interactions with the FtsZ protein.},

@article{Ramm-2019,
	abstract = {Molecular self-organziation, also regarded as pattern formation, is crucial for the correct distribution of cellular content. The processes leading to spatiotemporal patterns often involve a multitude of molecules interacting in complex networks, so that only very few cellular pattern-forming systems can be regarded as well understood. Due to its compositional simplicity, the Escherichia coli MinCDE system has, thus, become a paradigm for protein pattern formation. This biological reaction diffusion system spatiotemporally positions the division machinery in E. coli and is closely related to ParA-type ATPases involved in most aspects of spatiotemporal organization in bacteria. The ATPase MinD and the ATPase-activating protein MinE self-organize on the membrane as a reaction matrix. In vivo, these two proteins typically oscillate from pole-to-pole, while in vitro they can form a variety of distinct patterns. MinC is a passenger protein supposedly operating as a downstream cue of the system, coupling it to the division machinery. The MinCDE system has helped to extract not only the principles underlying intracellular patterns, but also how they are shaped by cellular boundaries. Moreover, it serves as a model to investigate how patterns can confer information through specific and non-specific interactions with other molecules. Here, we review how the three Min proteins self-organize to form patterns, their response to geometric boundaries, and how these patterns can in turn induce patterns of other molecules, focusing primarily on experimental approaches and developments.},

@article{Adams-2015,
	abstract = {To proliferate efficiently, cells must co-ordinate division with chromosome segregation. In Bacillus subtilis, the nucleoid occlusion protein Noc binds to specific DNA sequences (NBSs) scattered around the chromosome and helps to protect genomic integrity by coupling the initiation of division to the progression of chromosome replication and segregation. However, how it inhibits division has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Noc associates with the cell membrane via an N-terminal amphipathic helix, which is necessary for function. Importantly, the membrane-binding affinity of this helix is weak and requires the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes, thus establishing a mechanism for DNA-dependent activation of Noc. Furthermore, division inhibition by Noc requires recruitment of NBS DNA to the cell membrane and is dependent on its ability to bind DNA and membrane simultaneously. Indeed, Noc production in a heterologous system is sufficient for recruitment of chromosomal DNA to the membrane. Our results suggest a simple model in which the formation of large membrane-associated nucleoprotein complexes physically occludes assembly of the division machinery.},

Its positioning is regulated by the oscillation of MinCDE proteins. MinC is activated by MinD through an unknown mechanism and prevents Z-ring assembly anywhere but midcell. Here, using X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy and in vivo analyses, we show that MinD activates MinC by forming a new class of alternating copolymeric filaments that show similarity to eukaryotic septin filaments. A non-polymerizing mutation in MinD causes aberrant cell division in Escherichia coli. MinCD copolymers bind to membrane, interact with FtsZ and are disassembled by MinE. Imaging a functional msfGFP-MinC fusion protein in MinE-deleted cells reveals filamentous structures. EM imaging of our reconstitution of the MinCD-FtsZ interaction on liposome surfaces reveals a plausible mechanism for regulation of FtsZ ring assembly by MinCD copolymers.},

We constructed a Mycoplasma genitalium ftsZ null mutant by gene replacement to investigate the role of this gene and the presence of alternative cell division mechanisms in this minimal bacterium. Our results demonstrate that ftsZ is non-essential for cell growth and reveal that, in the absence of the FtsZ protein, M. genitalium can manage feasible cell divisions and cytokinesis using the force generated by its motile machinery. This is an alternative mechanism, completely independent of the FtsZ protein, to perform cell division by binary fission in a microorganism. We also propose that the mycoplasma cytoskeleton, a complex network of proteins involved in many aspects of the biology of these microorganisms, may have taken over the function of many genes involved in cell division, allowing their loss in the regressive evolution of the streamlined mycoplasma genomes.},

@article{Adams-2009,
	abstract = {The first recognizable event in bacterial cell division is the assembly of FtsZ into a ring-like structure at mid-cell. This Z ring serves as a scaffold for the assembly of the division machinery and contracts throughout division, guiding the synthesis of the nascent septum.FtsZ is the ancestral homologue of tubulin and assembles cooperatively, in a GTP-dependent manner, into longitudinal protofilaments similar to those of αβ-tubulin. Although the polymerization of FtsZ in vitro has been studied extensively, little is known about the architecture of the polymers that make up the Z ring in vivo.Importantly, the concentration of FtsZ in vivo is greatly in excess of the critical concentration for assembly. Despite this, the intracellular concentration of FtsZ does not vary greatly during the cell cycle. The initiation of cell division is instead regulated both spatially and temporally at the level of Z ring assembly, by an array of accessory proteins that can modulate the polymerization of FtsZ.FtsZ is a cytoplasmic protein, but it must be tethered to the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane to form the Z ring. This is achieved primarily by the action of FtsA, which is widely conserved and contains an amphipathic membrane-targeting sequence. Where present, ZipA, an integral membrane protein, can also allow Z ring assembly and, along with ZapA, also contributes to the stability of the Z ring.Other, early-assembling regulators, such as ZapB and SepF, potentially play a part in organizing the ultrastructure of the Z ring and, although it is not normally essential, SepF seems to contribute to this process and might also be able to act as a membrane tether.The Z ring is not a static structure. The polymers that constitute the Z ring are in a state of flux, with subunits rapidly exchanging between the polymer and the cytoplasmic pool. This turnover is stimulated by GTP hydrolysis and is regulated by the antagonistic behaviour of many non-essential proteins, including ZapA, extra Z rings A (EzrA) and ClpX.Several regulatory proteins also render the Z ring responsive to variations in the cell cycle by taking advantage of the accessibility of subunits that is afforded by the dynamic nature of the Z ring. UgtP delays cell division by destabilizing the Z ring, and the induction of SulA during the SOS response prevents new Z ring assembly and disassembles existing Z rings. In addition, during sporulation, mother cell inhibitor of FtsZ (MciZ) prevents inappropriate cell division once the process has been initiated.},

These structures provide new insight into the RecQ helicase mechanism of DNA tracking, strand separation, strand annealing, and Holliday junction (HJ) branch migration. We identified a surface region in the winged-helix domain of RECQ1 that is important for both dsDNA recognition and HJ resolution, and we used a combination of biochemical, analytical ultracentrifugation, and EM experiments to begin elucidating the molecular basis of the distinct HJ resolution activities of human RecQ helicases.RecQ helicases are a widely conserved family of ATP-dependent motors with diverse roles in nearly every aspect of bacterial and eukaryotic genome maintenance. However, the physical mechanisms by which RecQ helicases recognize and process specific DNA replication and repair intermediates are largely unknown. Here, we solved crystal structures of the human RECQ1 helicase in complexes with tailed-duplex DNA and ssDNA. The structures map the interactions of the ssDNA tail and the branch point along the helicase and Zn-binding domains, which, together with reported structures of other helicases, define the catalytic stages of helicase action. We also identify a strand-separating pin, which (uniquely in RECQ1) is buttressed by the protein dimer interface. A duplex DNA-binding surface on the C-terminal domain is shown to play a role in DNA unwinding, strand annealing, and Holliday junction (HJ) branch migration. We have combined EM and analytical ultracentrifugation approaches to show that RECQ1 can form what appears to be a flat, homotetrameric complex and propose that RECQ1 tetramers are involved in HJ recognition. This tetrameric arrangement suggests a platform for coordinated activity at the advancing and receding duplexes of an HJ during branch migration.},

To define the physical basis of RecQ enzyme function, we have determined a 1.8 {\AA} resolution crystal structure of the catalytic core of Escherichia coli RecQ in its unbound form and a 2.5 {\AA} resolution structure of the core bound to the ATP analog ATPγS. The RecQ core comprises four conserved subdomains; two of these combine to form its helicase region, while the others form unexpected Zn2+-binding and winged-helix motifs. The structures reveal the molecular basis of missense mutations that cause Bloom's syndrome, a human RecQ-associated disease. Finally, based on findings from the structures, we propose a mechanism for RecQ activity that could explain its functional coordination with topoisomerase III.},

	abstract = {Lentiviral vectors (LV) have seen considerably increase in use as gene therapy vectors for the treatment of acquired and inherited diseases. This review presents the state of the art of the production of these vectors with particular emphasis on their large-scale production for clinical purposes. In contrast to oncoretroviral vectors, which are produced using stable producer cell lines, clinical-grade LV are in most of the cases produced by transient transfection of 293 or 293T cells grown in cell factories. However, more recent developments, also, tend to use hollow fiber reactor, suspension culture processes, and the implementation of stable producer cell lines. As is customary for the biotech industry, rather sophisticated downstream processing protocols have been established to remove any undesirable process-derived contaminant, such as plasmid or host cell DNA or host cell proteins. This review compares published large-scale production and purification processes of LV and presents their process performances. Furthermore, developments in the domain of stable cell lines and their way to the use of production vehicles of clinical material will be presented.},

	abstract = {Protein folding is a highly complex process proceeding through a number of disordered and partially folded nonnative states with various degrees of structural organization. These transiently and sparsely populated species on the protein folding energy landscape play crucial roles in driving folding toward the native conformation, yet some of these nonnative states may also serve as precursors for protein misfolding and aggregation associated with a range of devastating diseases, including neuro-degeneration, diabetes and cancer. Therefore, in vivo protein folding is often reshaped co- and post-translationally through interactions with the ribosome, molecular chaperones and/or other cellular components. Owing to developments in instrumentation and methodology, solution NMR spectroscopy has emerged as the central experimental approach for the detailed characterization of the complex protein folding processes in vitro and in vivo. NMR relaxation dispersion and saturation transfer methods provide the means for a detailed characterization of protein folding kinetics and thermodynamics under native-like conditions, as well as modeling high-resolution structures of weakly populated short-lived conformational states on the protein folding energy landscape. Continuing development of isotope labeling strategies and NMR methods to probe high molecular weight protein assemblies, along with advances of in-cell NMR, have recently allowed protein folding to be studied in the context of ribosome-nascent chain complexes and molecular chaperones, and even inside living cells. Here we review solution NMR approaches to investigate the protein folding energy landscape, and discuss selected applications of NMR methodology to studying protein folding in vitro and in vivo. Together, these examples highlight a vast potential of solution NMR in providing atomistic insights into molecular mechanisms of protein folding and homeostasis in health and disease.},

In this study, we present a sample-efficient, free-solution method, termed microscale thermophoresis, that is capable of analysing interactions of proteins or small molecules in biological liquids such as blood serum or cell lysate. The technique is based on the thermophoresis of molecules, which provides information about molecule size, charge and hydration shell. We validated the method using immunologically relevant systems including human interferon gamma and the interaction of calmodulin with calcium. The affinity of the small-molecule inhibitor quercetin to its kinase PKA was determined in buffer and human serum, revealing a 400-fold reduced affinity in serum. This information about the influence of the biological matrix may allow to make more reliable conclusions on protein functionality, and may facilitate more efficient drug development.},

We solved a 2.8-{\AA}resolution crystal structure of human Wnt3 in complex with mouse Frizzled 8 Cys-rich domain (CRD). Wnt3 grabs the receptor in a manner very similar to that found in Xenopus Wnt8 complexed with the same receptor. Unlike Xenopus Wnt8-bound CRD, however, Wnt3-bound CRD formed a symmetrical dimer in the crystal by exchanging the tip of the unsaturated acyl chain attached to each Wnt3, confirming the ability of Wnt and Frizzled CRD to form a 2:2 complex. The hypervariable `linker'region of Wnt3 formed a β-hairpin protrusion opposite from the Frizzled binding interface, consistent with its proposed role in the coreceptor recognition. Direct binding between this segment and the Wnt coreceptor LRP6 was confirmed, enabling us to build a structural model of the Wnt--Frizzled--LRP6 ternary complex.},

These experiments have largely set the stage for the proton pump mechanism. The structures of the catalytic binuclear heme‑copper site that is common to the huge family of heme‑copper oxidases, are today well understood throughout the catalytic cycle of oxygen reduction to water based on both spectroscopic studies and quantum chemical calculations. Here, we briefly review this progress, and add some recent details into how the proton pump mechanism is protected from failure by leakage.},

Because the heat dissipation process is proportional to light-driven thylakoid lumen acidification, manipulating thylakoid ion and proton flux via transport proteins could improve photosynthesis. However, an important aspect of the current understanding of the thylakoid ion transportome is inaccurate. Using fluorescent protein fusions, we show that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) two-pore K+ channel TPK3, which had been reported to mediate thylakoid K+ flux, localizes to the tonoplast, not the thylakoid. The localization of TPK3 outside of the thylakoids is further supported by the absence of TPK3 in isolated thylakoids as well as the inability of isolated chloroplasts to import TPK3 protein. In line with the subcellular localization of TPK3 in the vacuole, we observed that photosynthesis in the Arabidopsis null mutant tpk3-1, which carries a transfer DNA insertion in the first exon, remains unaffected. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how thylakoid ion flux impacts photosynthetic efficiency under dynamic growth light regimes, we performed long-term photosynthesis imaging of established and newly isolated transthylakoid K+- and Cl−-flux mutants. Our results underpin the importance of the thylakoid ion transport proteins potassium cation efflux antiporter KEA3 and voltage-dependent chloride channel VCCN1 and suggest that the activity of yet unknown K+ channel(s), but not TPK3, is critical for optimal photosynthesis in dynamic light environments.},

Complex I contains a flavin mononucleotide to oxidize NADH, and an unusually long series of iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters, in several subunits, to transfer the electrons to quinone. Understanding coupled electron transfer in complex I requires a detailed knowledge of the properties of individual clusters and of the cluster ensemble, and so it requires the correlation of spectroscopic and structural data: This has proved a challenging task. EPR studies on complex I from Bos taurus have established that EPR signals N1b, N2 and N3 arise, respectively, from the 2Fe cluster in the 75 kDa subunit, and from 4Fe clusters in the PSST and 51 kDa subunits (positions 2, 7, and 1 along the seven-cluster chain extending from the flavin). The other clusters have either evaded detection or definitive signal assignments have not been established. Here, we combine double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy on B. taurus complex I with the structure of the hydrophilic domain of Thermus thermophilus complex I. By considering the magnetic moments of the clusters and the orientation selectivity of the DEER experiment explicitly, signal N4 is assigned to the first 4Fe cluster in the TYKY subunit (position 5), and N5 to the all-cysteine ligated 4Fe cluster in the 75 kDa subunit (position 3). The implications of our assignment for the mechanisms of electron transfer and energy transduction by complex I are discussed.},

	abstract = {The mitochondrial inner membrane has a complex and dynamic structure that plays an important role in the function of this organelle. The internal compartments called cristae are created by processes that are just beginning to be understood. Crista size and morphology influence the internal diffusion of solutes and the surface area of the inner membrane, which is home to critical membrane proteins including ATP synthase and electron transport chain complexes; metabolite and ion transporters including the adenine nucleotide translocase, the calcium uniporter (MCU), and the sodium/calcium exchanger (NCLX); and many more. Here we provide a brief overview of what is known about crista structure and formation, and discuss mitochondrial function in the context of that structure. We also suggest that mathematical modeling of mitochondria that incorporates accurate information about the organelle's internal architecture can lead to a better understanding of its diverse functions.

@article{Wirth-2016,
	abstract = {Proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the largest and most complicated enzyme of the respiratory chain. Fourteen central subunits represent the minimal form of complex I and can be assigned to functional modules for NADH oxidation, ubiquinone reduction, and proton pumping. In addition, the mitochondrial enzyme comprises some 30 accessory subunits surrounding the central subunits that are not directly associated with energy conservation. Complex I is known to release deleterious oxygen radicals (ROS) and its dysfunction has been linked to a number of hereditary and degenerative diseases. We here review recent progress in structure determination, and in understanding the role of accessory subunits and functional analysis of mitochondrial complex I. For the central subunits, structures provide insight into the arrangement of functional modules including the substrate binding sites, redox-centers and putative proton channels and pump sites. Only for two of the accessory subunits, detailed structures are available. Nevertheless, many of them could be localized in the overall structure of complex I, but most of these assignments have to be considered tentative. Strikingly, redox reactions and proton pumping machinery are spatially completely separated and the site of reduction for the hydrophobic substrate ubiquinone is found deeply buried in the hydrophilic domain of the complex. The X-ray structure of complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica provides clues supporting the previously proposed two-state stabilization change mechanism, in which ubiquinone redox chemistry induces conformational states and thereby drives proton pumping. The same structural rearrangements may explain the active/deactive transition of complex I implying an integrated mechanistic model for energy conversion and regulation.

A hydrogen-bonded system, including a propionate of a heme A (heme a), part of peptide backbone, and an imidazole ligand of CuA, could provide an electron transfer pathway between CuA and heme a. Two possible proton pathways for pumping, each spanning from the matrix to the cytosolic surfaces, were identified, including hydrogen bonds, internal cavities likely to contain water molecules, and structures that could form hydrogen bonds with small possible conformational change of amino acid side chains. Possible channels for chemical protons to produce H2O, for removing the produced water, and for O2, respectively, were identified.},

Complex-IV is the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain, existing either as randomly scattered complexes or as a component of supercomplexes. NDUFA4 was previously assumed as a subunit of complex-I, but recent biochemical data suggested it may be a subunit of complex-IV. However, no structural evidence supporting this notion was available till now. Here we obtained the 3.3 {\AA}resolution structure of complex-IV derived from the human supercomplex I1III2IV1 and assigned the NDUFA4 subunit into complex-IV. Intriguingly, NDUFA4 lies exactly at the dimeric interface observed in previously reported crystal structures of complex-IV homodimer which would preclude complex-IV dimerization. Combining previous structural and biochemical data shown by us and other groups, we propose that the intact complex-IV is a monomer containing 14 subunits.},

Electrons moved freely within and between monomers, crossing an electron-transfer bridge between two hemes in the core of the dimer. This revealed an H-shaped electron-transfer system that distributes electrons between four quinone oxidation-reduction terminals at the corners of the dimer within the millisecond time scale of enzymatic turnover.

It has a central role in cellular energy production and has been implicated in many human neurodegenerative diseases. The L-shaped enzyme consists of hydrophilic and membrane domains. Previously, we determined the structure of the hydrophilic domain. Here we report the crystal structure of the Esherichia coli complex I membrane domain at 3.0 {\AA}resolution. It includes six subunits, NuoL, NuoM, NuoN, NuoA, NuoJ and NuoK, with 55 transmembrane helices. The fold of the homologous antiporter-like subunits L, M and N is novel, with two inverted structural repeats of five transmembrane helices arranged, unusually, face-to-back. Each repeat includes a discontinuous transmembrane helix and forms half of a channel across the membrane. A network of conserved polar residues connects the two half-channels, completing the proton translocation pathway. Unexpectedly, lysines rather than carboxylate residues act as the main elements of the proton pump in these subunits. The fourth probable proton-translocation channel is at the interface of subunits N, K, J and A. The structure indicates that proton translocation in complex I, uniquely, involves coordinated conformational changes in six symmetrical structural elements.},

Distances are short or long as required to direct or insulate promiscuously tunneling single electrons. Along a chain, distances are usually 14 {\AA}or less. Shorter distances are needed to allow climbing of added energetic barriers at paired-electron catalytic centers in which substrate and the required number of cofactors form a compact cluster. When there is a short-circuit danger, distances between shorting centers are relatively long. Distances much longer than 14{\AA}will support only very slow electron tunneling, but could act as high impedance signals useful in regulation. Tunneling simulations of the respiratory complexes provide clear illustrations of this simple engineering.},

	abstract = {Cell membrane capacitance and conductance are key pieces of intrinsic information correlated with the cellular dielectric parameters and morphology of the plasma membrane; these parameters have been used as electrophysiological biomarkers to characterize cellular phenotype and state, and they have many associated clinical applications. Here, we present our work on the non-invasive determination of cell membrane capacitance and conductance by an optically activated microfluidics chip. The model for determining the cell membrane capacitance and conductance was established by a single layer of the shell-core polarization model. Three-dimensional finite-element analyses of the positive and negative optically induced dielectrophoresis forces generated by the projected light arrays of spots were performed, thus providing a theoretical validation of the feasibility of this approach. Then, the crossover frequency spectra for four typical types of cells (Raji cells, MCF-7 cells, HEK293 cells, and K562 cells) were experimentally investigated by using a micro-vision based motion-tracking technique. The different responses of these cells to the positive and negative ODEP forces were studied under four different liquid conductivities by automatic observation and tracking of the cellular trajectory and texture during the cells'translation. The cell membrane capacitance and conductance were determined from the curve-fitted spectra, which were 11.1 $\pm$0.9 mF/m2 and 782 $\pm$32 S/m2, respectively, for Raji cells, 11.5 $\pm$0.8 mF/m2 and 114 $\pm$28 S/m2 for MCF-7 cells, 9.0 $\pm$0.9 mF/m2 and 187 $\pm$22 S/m2 for HEK293 cells, and 10.2 $\pm$0.7 mF/m2 and 879 $\pm$24 S/m2 for K562 cells. Furthermore, as an application of this technique, the membrane capacitances of MCF-7 cells treated with four different concentrations of drugs were acquired. This technique introduces a determination of cell membrane capacitance and conductance that yields statistically significant data while allowing information from individual cells to be obtained in a non-invasive manner.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence measurements of pH and other analytes in the cell rely on accurate calibrations, but these have routinely used algorithms that inadequately describe the properties of indicators. Here, we have established a more accurate method for calibrating and analyzing data obtained using the ratiometric probe 5(6)-carboxy-SNARF-1. We tested the implications of novel approach to measurements of pH in yeast mitochondria, a compartment containing a small number of free H+ ions. Our findings demonstrate that 5(6)-carboxy-SNARF-1 interacts with H+ ions inside the mitochondria in an anticooperative manner (Hill coefficient n of 0.5) and the apparent pH inside the mitochondria is ~0.5 unit lower than had been generally assumed. This result, at odds with the current consensus on the mechanism of energy generation in the mitochondria, is in better agreement with theoretical considerations and warrants further studies of organellar pH.},

@article{Mitchell:1967a,
	abstract = {{1. Pulses of acidity of the outer aqueous phase of rat liver mitochondrial suspensions induced by pulses of respiration are due to the translocation of H+ (or OH−) ions across the osmotic barrier (M phase) of the cristae membrane and cannot be attributed to the formation (with acid production) of a chemical intermediate that subsequently decomposes. 2. The effective quantity of protons translocated per bivalent reducing equivalent passing through the succinate-oxidizing and β-hydroxybutyrate-oxidizing spans of the respiratory chain are very close to 4 and 6 respectively. These quotients are constant between pH5·5 and 8·5 and are independent of changes in the ionic composition of the mitochondrial suspension medium provided that the conditions permit the accurate experimental measurement of the proton translocation. 3. Apparent changes in the →H+/O quotients may be induced by conditions preventing the occurrence of the usual backlash; these apparent changes of →H+/O are attributable to a very fast electrically driven component of the decay of the acid pulses that is not included in the experimental extrapolations. 4. Apparent changes in the →H+/O quotients may also be induced by the presence of anions, such as succinate, malonate and phosphate, or by cations such as Na+. These apparent changes of →H+/O are due to an increase in the rate of the pH-driven decay of the acid pulses. 5. The uncoupling agents, 2,4-dinitrophenol, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and gramicidin increase the effective proton conductance of the M phase and thus increase the rate of decay of the respiration-driven acid pulses, but do not change the initial →H+/O quotients. The increase in effective proton conductance of the M phase caused by these uncouplers accounts quantitatively for their uncoupling action; and the fact that the initial →H+/O quotients are unchanged shows that uncoupler-sensitive chemical intermediates do not exist between the respiratory-chain system and the effective proton-translocating mechanism. 6. Stoicheiometric acid--base changes associated with the activity of the regions of the respiratory chain on the oxygen side of the rotenone- and antimycin A-sensitive sites gives experimental support for a suggested configuration of loop 3.}},
