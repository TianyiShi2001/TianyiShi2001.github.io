  abstract: Haematopoietic stem cells renew blood. Accumulation of DNA damage in these
    cells promotes their decline, while misrepair of this damage initiates malignancies.
    Here we describe the features and mutational landscape of DNA damage caused by
    acetaldehyde, an endogenous and alcohol-derived metabolite. This damage results
    in DNA double-stranded breaks that, despite stimulating recombination repair,
    also cause chromosome rearrangements. We combined transplantation of single haematopoietic
    stem cells with whole-genome sequencing to show that this damage occurs in stem
    cells, leading to deletions and rearrangements that are indicative of microhomology-mediated
    end-joining repair. Moreover, deletion of p53 completely rescues the survival
    of aldehyde-stressed and mutated haematopoietic stem cells, but does not change
    the pattern or the intensity of genome instability within individual stem cells.
    These findings characterize the mutation of the stem-cell genome by an alcohol-derived
    and endogenous source of DNA damage. Furthermore, we identify how the choice of
    DNA-repair pathway and a stringent p53 response limit the transmission of aldehyde-induced
    mutations in stem cells.

  abstract: Author Summary Abnormal signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor
    (EGFR) contributes to the development of various human diseases, including different
    cancer types. One important mechanism that controls intracellular signal transduction
    is by regulation of the subcellular receptor localization in the signal-receiving
    cell. We are investigating the regulation of the EGFR homolog LET-23 in the Nematode
    C. elegans by observing the localization of the EGFR in the epithelial cells of
    live animals. This approach has allowed us to study the dynamics of receptor trafficking
    in cells embedded in their natural environment and receiving physiological concentrations
    of various extracellular signals. In a systematic RNA interference screen, we
    have identified 81 genes controlling EGFR localization and signaling in different
    subcellular compartments. One new regulator of EGFR signaling identified in this
    screen encodes the Ezrin Homolog ERM-1. We show genetic and biochemical evidence
    indicating that ERM-1 is part of a buffering mechanism to maintain a pool of immobile
    EGFR in the basolateral membrane compartment of the epithelial cells. This mechanism
    permits the generation of a long-lasting EGFR signal during multiple rounds of
    cell divisions. The control of receptor localization is thus necessary for the
    precise temporal regulation of signal transduction during animal development.

  volume: '94'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: In C. elegans, the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase is localized to the
    basolateral membranes of polarized vulval epithelial cells. lin-2, lin-7, and
    lin-10 are required for basolateral localization of LET-23, since LET-23 is mislocalized
    to the apical membrane in lin-2, lin-7, and lin-10 mutants. Yeast two-hybrid,
    in vitro binding, and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation experiments show that LIN-2,
    LIN-7, and LIN-10 form a protein complex. Furthermore, compensatory mutations
    in lin-7 and let-23 exhibit allele-specific suppression of apical mislocalization
    and signaling-defective phenotypes. These results present a mechanism for basolateral
    localization of LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase by direct binding to the LIN-2/LIN-7/LIN-10
    complex. Each of the binding interactions within this complex is conserved, suggesting
    that this complex may also mediate basolateral localization in mammals.

  container-title: Nature Communications
  page: '7053'
  volume: '6'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: How cells in developing organisms interpret the quantitative information
    contained in morphogen gradients is an open question. Here we address this question
    using a novel integrative approach that combines quantitative measurements of
    morphogen-induced gene expression at single-mRNA resolution with mathematical
    modelling of the induction process. We focus on the induction of Notch ligands
    by the LIN-3/EGF morphogen gradient during vulva induction in Caenorhabditis elegans.
    We show that LIN-3/EGF-induced Notch ligand expression is highly dynamic, exhibiting
    an abrupt transition from low to high expression. Similar transitions in Notch
    ligand expression are observed in two highly divergent wild C. elegans isolates.
    Mathematical modelling and experiments show that this transition is driven by
    a dynamic increase in the sensitivity of the induced cells to external LIN-3/EGF.
    Furthermore, this increase in sensitivity is independent of the presence of LIN-3/EGF.
    Our integrative approach might be useful to study induction by morphogen gradients
    in other systems.

  abstract: During development of the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite, the gonadal
    anchor cell induces nearby Pn.p cells to adopt vulval fates. The response to this
    signal is mediated by a receptor tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathway that
    has been remarkably well conserved during metazoan evolution. Because mitogen-activated
    protein (MAP) kinases are activated by receptor tyrosine kinase pathways in vertebrate
    cells, we hypothesized that C. elegans MAP kinase homologs may play a role in
    vulval induction. Two C. elegans MAP kinase genes, mpk-1 and mpk-2 (mpk, MAP kinase),
    were cloned using degenerate oligonucleotide primers and PCR amplification; in
    parallel, genes involved in vulval induction were identified by screening for
    mutations that suppress the vulval defects caused by an activated let-60 ras gene.
    One such suppressor mutation is an allele of mpk-1. We used a new type of mosaic
    analysis to show that mpk-1 acts cell autonomously in the Pn.p cells. Our results
    show that mpk-1 plays an important functional role as an activator in ras-mediated
    cell signaling in vivo.

  abstract: An evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway that utilizes
    a receptor tyrosine kinase and a Ras protein mediates the induction of vulval
    cell fates in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We sought new genes that function
    in this pathway by screening for suppressors of the Multivulva phenotype caused
    by a mutation that activates the let-60 ras gene. Seven such suppressor mutations
    defined a new gene involved in vulval induction. We named this gene mek-2, because
    its predicted protein product is most similar to MEK, a protein-serine/threonine
    and tyrosine kinase. mek-2 mutations can be arranged in an allelic series. A probable
    null mutation eliminated vulval induction, and the strongest mutations alter codons
    conserved in most or all protein kinases. Our genetic analysis showed that mek-2
    functions downstream of let-60 ras and is required for ras-mediated signal transduction
    in vivo. The MEK-2 protein may interact with the products of the lin-45 raf and
    mpk-1 MAP kinase genes, which also mediate vulval induction.

  container-title: Cell
  page: 679 - 693
  volume: '58'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: 'Each of the six C. elegans vulval precursor cells (VPCs) has three
    potential fates (1$\,^{\circ}$, 2$\,^{\circ}$, or 3$\,^{\circ}$). The fate of
    each VPC depends on two types of signals: a graded inductive signal that acts
    at a distance and a short-range lateral signal among the VPCs. We describe interactions
    among mutations that cause different misspecifications of VPC fates. Particular
    combinations of mutations cause all six VPCs to have a single fate independent
    of their positions. Our results suggest that specification of the three VPC fates
    is accomplished by two binary decisions, each effected by one of the two signaling
    pathways. The gene lin-12 acts in the lateral signaling pathway and specifies
    2$\,^{\circ}$. The “vulvaless” and “multivulva” genes act in the inductive signaling
    pathway and specify 1$\,^{\circ}$ independently of lin-12 and 2$\,^{\circ}$ via
    lin-12. We describe a model for the regulatory circuitry underlying VPC determination
    that includes a role for lin-12 in both autocrine and paracrine VPC signaling.'

  abstract: Protein phosphorylation by kinases and the subsequent dephosphorylation
    by phosphatases are key mechanisms that regulate intracellular signal transduction
    during development. Here, we report the identification of the receptor protein
    tyrosine phosphatase DEP-1 as a negative regulator of the Caenorhabditis elegans
    EGF receptor. DEP-1 amplifies in the developing vulva and the excretory system
    the small differences in the amount of EGF signal received by equivalent precursor
    cells to achieve binary cell fate decisions. During vulval development, DEP-1
    inhibits EGFR signaling in the secondary cell lineage in parallel with the NOTCH-mediated
    lateral inhibition, while EGFR signaling simultaneously down-regulates DEP-1 and
    NOTCH expression in the primary cell lineage. This regulatory network of inhibitors
    results in the full activation of the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway in the primary vulval
    cells and at the same time keeps the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway inactive in the adjacent
    secondary cells. Mammalian Dep-1/Scc1 functions as a tumor-suppressor gene in
    the intestinal epithelium. Thus, mutations in human Dep-1 may promote tumor formation
    through a hyperactivation of the EGF receptor.

  abstract: The LIN-1 ETS transcription factor inhibits vulval cell fates during Caenorhabditis
    elegans development. We demonstrate that LIN-1 interacts with UBC-9, a small ubiquitin-related
    modifier (SUMO) conjugating enzyme. This interaction is mediated by two consensus
    sumoylation motifs in LIN-1. Biochemical studies showed that LIN-1 is covalently
    modified by SUMO-1. ubc-9 and smo-1, the gene encoding SUMO-1, inhibit vulval
    cell fates and function at the level of lin-1, indicating that sumoylation promotes
    LIN-1 inhibition of vulval cell fates. Sumoylation of LIN-1 promoted transcriptional
    repression and mediated an interaction with MEP-1, a protein previously shown
    to associate with the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) transcriptional
    repression complex. Genetic studies showed that mep-1 inhibits vulval cell fates
    and functions at the level of lin-1. We propose that sumoylation of LIN-1 mediates
    an interaction with MEP-1 that contributes to transcriptional repression of genes
    that promote vulval cell fates. These studies identify a molecular mechanism for
    SUMO-mediated transcriptional repression.

  note: Developmental mechanisms, patterning and organogenesis
  abstract: The Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite vulva is one of the best studied
    models for signal transduction and cell fate determination during organogenesis.
    Systematic forward genetic screens have identified a complex and highly interconnected
    signaling network formed by the conserved EGFR, NOTCH, and WNT signaling pathways
    that specifies an invariant pattern of cell fates among the six vulval precursor
    cells (VPCs). Multiple inhibitory interactions between the EGFR and NOTCH pathways
    ensure the selection of a single 1$\,^{\circ}$ VPC that is always flanked by two
    2$\,^{\circ}$ VPCs thanks to lateral NOTCH signaling. Building on this ‘central
    dogma’ of cell fate specification, scientists have investigated a broad spectrum
    of novel questions that are summarized in this review. For example, vulval development
    is a unique model to study the intracellular trafficking of signaling molecules,
    such as NOTCH or EGFR, to investigate the interactions between the cell cycle
    and cell fate specification pathways, and to observe epithelial tube morphogenesis
    and cell invasion at single-cell resolution. Finally, computer scientists have
    integrated the experimental data into mathematical and state-based ‘in silico’
    models of vulval development, allowing them to test the completeness and limits
    of our current understanding.

  abstract: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated activation of the canonical
    Ras/MAPK signaling cascade is responsible for cell proliferation and cell growth.
    This signaling pathway is frequently overactivated in epithelial cancers; therefore,
    studying regulation of this pathway is crucial not only for our fundamental understanding
    of cell biology but also for our ability to treat EGFR-related disease. Genetic
    model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans, a hermaphroditic nematode, played
    a vital role in identifying components of the EGFR/Ras/MAPK pathway and delineating
    their order of function, and continues to play a role in identifying novel regulators
    of the pathway. Polarized activation of LET-23, the C. elegans homolog of EGFR,
    is responsible for induction of the vulval cell fate; perturbations in this signaling
    pathway produce either a vulvaless or multivulva phenotype. The translucent cuticle
    of the nematode facilitates in vivo visualization of the receptor, revealing that
    localization of LET-23 EGFR is tightly regulated and linked to its function. In
    this chapter, we review the methods used to harness vulva development as a tool
    for studying EGFR signaling and trafficking in C. elegans.

  title: A major strength of c. Elegans as a model system is the ease of conducting
    unbiased forward genetic screens to identify mutants and genes relevant to a biological
    process of interest. Many studies on rtk-ras-erk signaling have focused on the
    role of the let-23/egfr pathway in promoting vulval development (see vulval development),
    and many core components of the pathway were first identified through forward
    genetic screens for mutants with vul or muv mutant phenotypes (ferguson and horvitz,
    1985).

  abstract: The let-60 gene, an essential ras gene of the nematode Caenorhabditis
    elegans, acts as a switch in the inductive signalling pathway that initiates vulva
    formation. Recessive let-60 mutations that cause a vulvaless phenotype prevent
    let-60 function in response to the inductive signal. These mutations are clustered
    and define regions necessary either for the activation or for the action of the
    let-60 ras protein. Dominant let-60 mutations that cause a multivulva phenotype
    alter codon 13 and activate let-60 in vivo, rendering it independent of the inductive
    signal. The let-60 gene acts within an extensively defined genetic pathway, and
    other genes within this pathway seem likely to encode molecules that regulate
    let-60 function as well as molecules that are targets of let-60 action.

  abstract: Egg laying by the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans requires the functioning
    of the vulva, the gonad, the egg-laying muscles, and the two HSN neurons, which
    innervate these muscles. By analyzing a newly isolated mutant (dig-1) that displaces
    the gonad, we discovered that cell interactions coordinate the spatial relationships
    among the different components of the egg-laying system. First, the gonad induces
    the formation of the vulva, and vulval induction by dorsal gonads strongly suggests
    that the inductive signal can act at a distance. Second, the gonad acts at a distance
    to regulate the migrations of the sex myoblasts that generate the egg-laying musculature.
    Third, the positions of the axonal branch and synapses of each HSN neuron are
    displaced correspondingly with the rest of the egg-laying system in dig-1 animals,
    which suggests that cell interactions also control aspects of HSN development.

  abstract: Ever since the cell lineage of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was
    shown to be nearly invariant, investigators have tried to understand the mechanisms
    that control these precise patterns of cell divisions and cell fates. Important
    insights have come from analyzing the cells that form the hermaphrodite vulva,
    a specialized hypodermal passageway used for egg laying and sperm entry. Early
    experiments showed that the invariant pattern of vulval cell fates requires highly
    reproducible intercellular signals. This review describes recent experiments that
    have begun to characterize molecules that mediate these signals and explore the
    relationships between different signaling pathways. Many of these molecules and
    signaling pathways have been conserved during evolution suggesting mechanisms
    used to establish patterns of cell fates during vulval development have also been
    conserved.

  title: Sonic hedgehog pathway is essential for maintenance of cancer stem-like cells
    in human gastric cancer
  container-title: PLOS ONE
  publisher: Public Library of Science
  page: '1-13'
  volume: '6'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Abnormal activation of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway has been described
    in a wide variety of human cancers and in cancer stem cells (CSCs), however, the
    role of SHH pathway in gastric CSCs has not been reported. In this study, we investigated
    the possibility that abnormal activation of the SHH pathway maintained the characteristics
    of gastric CSCs. First, we identified cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) from human
    gastric cancer cell lines (HGC-27, MGC-803 and MKN-45) using tumorsphere culture.
    Compared with adherent cells, the floating tumorsphere cells had more self-renewing
    capacity and chemoresistance. The cells expressing CSCs markers (CD44, CD24 and
    CD133) were also significantly more in tumorsphere cells than in adherent cells.
    More importantly, in vivo xenograft studies showed that tumors could be generated
    with 2×104 tumorsphere cells, which was 100-fold less than those required for
    tumors seeding by adherent cells. Next, RT-PCR and Western blot showed that the
    expression levels of Ptch and Gli1 (SHH pathway target genes) were significantly
    higher in tumorsphere cells than in adherent cells. The results of quantitative
    real-time PCR were similar to those of RT-PCR and Western blot. Further analysis
    revealed that SHH pathway blocked by cyclopamine or 5E1 caused a higher reduction
    in self-renewing capacity of HGC-27 tumorsphere cells than that of adherent cells.
    We also found that SHH pathway blocking strongly enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapeutic
    drugs in HGC-27 tumorsphere cells in vitro and in vivo but had no significant
    effect in adherent cells. Finally, we isolated the tumorspheres from gastric cancer
    specimen, these cells also had chemoresistance and tumorigenic capacity, and SHH
    pathway maintained the gastric CSLCs characteristics of tumorsphere cells from
    primary tumor samples. In conclusion, our data suggested that SHH pathway was
    essential for maintenance of CSLCs in human gastric cancer.

  note: Cell reprogramming, regeneration and repair
  abstract: In this decade, great progress has been made in the field of organ regeneration
    by incorporating emerging concepts from the fields of stem cell biology and developmental
    biology, and this progress has pioneered a new frontier in regenerative medicine.
    The generation of bioengineered organ germ-utilizing, fate-determined, organ-inductive
    epithelial and mesenchymal cells has provided evidence for the concept of functional
    organ regeneration in vivo. Organoid studies have verified that nearly all organs
    can be generated in the form of a mini-organ by recapitulating embryonic body
    patterning and establishing an organ-forming field among self-organizing pluripotent
    stem cells by utilizing cytokines that mimic the patterning and positional signals
    of organogenesis. More recently, the regeneration of an integumentary organ system
    composed of multiple organs, including hair follicles, has been achieved, demonstrating
    that regenerative medicine is forthcoming. In this review, we will introduce current
    research trends aimed at regenerating a functional three-dimensional (3D) organ,
    and we will discuss the potential use of these recent achievements and future
    directions needed to realize the next-generation of regenerative therapy for organ
    replacement.

  note: Cellular and Molecular Biology Techniques for Biomaterials Evaluation
  abstract: The response of host organisms (including at the protein and cellular
    level) to nanomaterials is different than that observed to conventional materials.
    Nanomaterials are those materials which possess constituents less than 100nm in
    at least one direction. This review will first introduce the use of nanomaterials
    in a variety of implant applications highlighting their promise towards regenerating
    tissues. Such reviewed studies will emphasize interactions of nanomaterials with
    various proteins and subsequently cells. Moreover, such advances in the use of
    nanomaterials as novel implants have been largely, to date, determined by conventional
    methods. However, the novel structure–property relationships unique for nanosized
    materials reside at the nanoscale. That is, the novelty of a nanomaterial can
    only be fully appreciated by characterizing their interactions with biological
    systems (such as proteins) with nanoscale resolution analytical tools. This characterization
    of nanomaterials at the nanoscale is critical to understanding and, hence, further
    promoting increased tissue growth on nanomaterials. For this reason, while more
    tools are needed for this emerging field, this review will also cover currently
    available surface characterization techniques that emphasize nanoscale resolution
    pertinent for characterizing biological interactions with nanomaterials, including
    attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy,
    X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy
    (SIMS), colorimetric biological assays, circular dichroism (CD), and atomic force
    microscopy (AFM). Only through the coordination of nanoscale analytical tools
    with studies that highlight mechanisms of increased tissue growth on nanomaterials
    will we be able to design better implant materials.

    the two different types of sedimentation experiment – sedimentation equilibrium
    and sedimentation velocity – for the analysis of protein–protein interactions
    and indicate how major complications such as thermodynamic and hydrodynamic non-ideality
    can be dealt with.

    increased. In addition, new computation and bioinformatics methods have been developed
    and new reference databases have been created, which greatly improve and facilitate
    the analyses of CD spectra. This article discusses recent developments in the
    analysis of protein secondary structures, including features of the DICHROWEB
    analysis webserver.

  volume: '870'
  abstract: Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a powerful structural method allowing
    one to study the structure, folding state and flexibility of native particles
    and complexes in solution and to rapidly analyze structural changes in response
    to variations in external conditions. New high brilliance sources and novel data
    analysis methods significantly enhanced resolution and reliability of structural
    models provided by the technique. Automation of the SAXS experiment, data processing
    and interpretation make solution SAXS a streamline tool for large scale structural
    studies in molecular biology. The method provides low resolution macromolecular
    shapes ab initio and is readily combined with other structural and biochemical
    techniques in integrative studies. Very importantly, SAXS is sensitive to macromolecular
    flexibility being one of the few structural techniques applicable to flexible
    systems and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). A major recent development
    is the use of SAXS to study particle dynamics in solution by ensemble approaches,
    which allow one to quantitatively characterize flexible systems. Of special interest
    is the joint use of SAXS with solution NMR, given that both methods yield highly
    complementary structural information, in particular, for IDPs. In this chapter,
    we present the basics of SAXS and also consider protocols of the experiment and
    data analysis for different scenarios depending on the type of the studied object.
    These include ab initio shape reconstruction, validation of available high resolution
    structures and rigid body modelling for folded macromolecules and also characterisation
    of flexible proteins with the ensemble methods. The methods are illustrated by
    examples of recent applications and further perspectives of the integrative use
    of SAXS with NMR in the studies of IDPs are discussed.

    flexible proteins and IDPs using SAXS are discussed from the practical point of
    view. Examples of the synergistic use of SAXS with high resolution methods like
    X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), as well as other experimental
    and in silico techniques to characterize completely, or partially unstructured
    proteins, are presented.

  abstract: Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a biophysical method to study the
    overall shape and structural transitions of biological macromolecules in solution.
    SAXS provides low resolution information on the shape, conformation and assembly
    state of proteins, nucleic acids and various macromolecular complexes. The technique
    also offers powerful means for the quantitative analysis of flexible systems,
    including intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Here, the basic principles
    of SAXS are presented, and profits and pitfalls of the characterization of multidomain
    flexible proteins and IDPs using SAXS are discussed from the practical point of
    view. Examples of the synergistic use of SAXS with high resolution methods like
    X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), as well as other experimental
    and in silico techniques to characterize completely, or partially unstructured
    proteins, are presented.

    β-peptides of alzheimer’s disease
  container-title: Journal of Molecular Biology
  page: 1075 - 1093
  volume: '225'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: 'The A4 or β-peptide (39 to 43 amino acid residues) is the principal
    proteinaceous component of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer’s disease. Using circular
    dichroism (c.d.), we have studied the secondary structures and aggregational properties
    in solution of 4 synthetic amyloid β-peptides: β-(1–28), β-(1–39), β-(1–42) and
    β-(29–42). The natural components of cerebrovascular deposits and extracellular
    amyloid plaques are β-(1–39) and β-(1–42), while β-(1–28) and β-(29–42) are unnatural
    fragments. The β-(1–28), β-(1–39) and β-(1–42) peptides adopt mixtures of β-sheet,
    α-helix and random coil structures, with the relative proportions of each secondary
    structure being strongly dependent upon the solution conditions. In aqueous solution,
    β-sheet structure is favored for the β-(1–39) and β-(1–42) peptides, while in
    aqueous solution containing trifluoroethanol (TFE) or hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP),
    α-helical structure is favored for all 3 peptides. The α-helical structure unfolds
    with increasing temperature and is favored at pH 1 to 4 and pH 7 to 10; the β-sheet
    conformation is temperature insensitive and is favored at pH 4 to 7. Peptide concentration
    studies showed that the β-sheet conformation is oligomeric (intermolecular), whereas
    the α-helical conformation is monomeric (intramolecular). The rate of aggregation
    to the oligomeric β-sheet structure (α-helix → random coil → β-sheet) is also
    dependent upon the solution conditions such as the pH and peptide concentration;
    maximum β-sheet formation occurs at pH 5.4. These results suggest that β-peptide
    is not an intrinsically insoluble peptide. Thus, solution abnormalities, together
    with localized high peptide concentrations, which may occur in Alzheimer’s disease,
    may contribute to the formation of amyloid plaques. The hydrophobic β-(29–42)
    peptide adopts exclusively an intermolecular β-sheet conformation in aqueous solution
    despite changes in temperature or pH. Therefore, this segment may be the first
    region of the β-peptide to aggregate and may direct the folding of the complete
    β-peptide to produce the β-pleated sheet structure found in amyloid deposits.
    Differences between the solution conformations of the β-(1–39) and β-(1–42) peptides
    suggests that the last 3 C-terminal amino acids are crucial to amyloid deposition.'

  page: '229-233'
  volume: '10'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Researchers in the field of structural biology, especially X-ray crystallography
    and protein nuclear magnetic resonance, are interested in knowing as much as possible
    about the state of their target protein in solution. Not only is this knowledge
    relevant to studies of biological function, it also facilitates determination
    of a protein structure using homogeneous monodisperse protein samples. A researcher
    faced with a new protein to study will have many questions even after that protein
    has been purified. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) can provide all of this
    information readily from a small sample in a non-destructive way, without the
    need for labeling, enabling structure determination experiments without any wasting
    time and material on uncharacterized samples. In this article, I use examples
    to illustrate how AUC can contribute to protein structural analysis. Integrating
    information from a variety of biophysical experimental methods, such as X-ray
    crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry,
    AUC allows a more complete understanding of the structure and function of biomacromolecules.

    for sample preparation, data acquisition, and data analysis. Recent discoveries
    enabled by AUC with a fluorescence detection system and potential future applications

  abstract: Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have made it possible
    to solve structures of biological macromolecules at near atomic resolution. Development
    of more stable microscopes, improved direct electron detectors and faster software
    for image processing has enabled structural solution of not only large macromolecular
    (megadalton range) complexes but also small ( 60 kDa) proteins. As a result of
    the widespread use of the technique, we have also witnessed new developments of
    techniques for cryo-EM grid preparation of membrane protein samples. This includes
    new types of solubilization strategies that better stabilize these protein complexes
    and the development of new grid supports with proven efficacy in reducing the
    motion of the molecules during electron beam exposure. Here, we discuss the practicalities
    and recent challenges of membrane protein sample preparation and vitrification,
    as well as grid support and foil treatment in the context of the structure determination
    of protein complexes by single particle cryo-EM.

    also represents a rare opportunity to study the intrinsic conformational flexibility
    of macromolecular assemblies. Here, we review the key technological advancements

  volume: '512'
  issue: '7513'
  abstract: The γ-secretase complex, comprising presenilin 1 (PS1), PEN-2, APH-1 and
    nicastrin, is a membrane-embedded protease that controls a number of important
    cellular functions through substrate cleavage. Aberrant cleavage of the amyloid
    precursor protein (APP) results in aggregation of amyloid-β, which accumulates
    in the brain and consequently causes Alzheimer’s disease. Here we report the three-dimensional
    structure of an intact human γ-secretase complex at 4.5 Åresolution, determined
    by cryo-electron-microscopy single-particle analysis. The γ-secretase complex
    comprises a horseshoe-shaped transmembrane domain, which contains 19 transmembrane
    segments (TMs), and a large extracellular domain (ECD) from nicastrin, which sits
    immediately above the hollow space formed by the TM horseshoe. Intriguingly, nicastrin
    ECD is structurally similar to a large family of peptidases exemplified by the
    glutamate carboxypeptidase PSMA. This structure serves as an important basis for
    understanding the functional mechanisms of the γ-secretase complex.

  abstract: Dysfunction of the intramembrane protease γ-secretase is thought to cause
    Alzheimer’s disease, with most mutations derived from Alzheimer’s disease mapping
    to the catalytic subunit presenilin 1 (PS1). Here we report an atomic structure
    of human γ-secretase at 3.4 Åresolution, determined by single-particle cryo-electron
    microscopy. Mutations derived from Alzheimer’s disease affect residues at two
    hotspots in PS1, each located at the centre of a distinct four transmembrane segment
    (TM) bundle. TM2 and, to a lesser extent, TM6 exhibit considerable flexibility,
    yielding a plastic active site and adaptable surrounding elements. The active
    site of PS1 is accessible from the convex side of the TM horseshoe, suggesting
    considerable conformational changes in nicastrin extracellular domain after substrate
    recruitment. Component protein APH-1 serves as a scaffold, anchoring the lone
    transmembrane helix from nicastrin and supporting the flexible conformation of
    PS1. Ordered phospholipids stabilize the complex inside the membrane. Our structure
    serves as a molecular basis for mechanistic understanding of γ-secretase function.

  abstract: Alpha helical membrane proteins are the targets for many pharmaceutical

    years, substantial progress has been made in determining their atomic structure
    using X-ray crystallography. However, a major bottleneck still remains; the identification
    of conditions that give crystals that are suitable for structure determination.
    Over the past 10 years we have been analysing the crystallisation conditions reported
    for alpha helical membrane proteins with the aim to facilitate a rational approach
    to the design and implementation of successful crystallisation screens. The result
    has been the development of MemGold, MemGold2 and the additive screen MemAdvantage.
    The associated analysis, summarised and updated in this chapter, has revealed
    a number of surprisingly successfully strategies for crystallisation and detergent
    selection.

  abstract: Protein crystallography emerged in the early 1970s and is, to this day,
    one of the most powerful techniques for the analysis of enzyme mechanisms and
    macromolecular interactions at the atomic level. It is also an extremely powerful
    tool for drug design. This field has evolved together with developments in computer
    science and molecular biology, allowing faster three-dimensional structure determination
    of complex biological assemblies. In recent times, structural genomics initiatives
    have pushed the development of methods to further speed up this process. The algorithms
    initially defined in the last decade for structure determination are now more
    and more elaborate, but the computational tools have evolved toward simpler and
    more user-friendly packages and web interfaces. We present here a modest overview
    of the popular software packages that have been developed for solving protein
    structures, and give a few guidelines and examples for structure determination
    using the two most popular methods, molecular replacement and multiple anomalous
    dispersion.

  abstract: Abstract With the ability to resolve structures of macromolecules at atomic
    resolution, X-ray crystallography has been the most powerful tool in modern structural
    biology. At the same time, recent technical improvements have triggered a resolution
    revolution in the single particle cryo-EM method. While the two methods are different
    in many respects, from sample preparation to structure determination, they both
    have the power to solve macromolecular structures at atomic resolution. It is
    important to understand the unique advantages and caveats of the two methods in
    solving structures and to appreciate the complementary nature of the two methods
    in structural biology. In this review we provide some examples, and discuss how
    X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM can be combined in deciphering structures of
    macromolecules for our full understanding of their biological mechanisms.

  abstract: The method of molecular structure determination by X-ray crystallography
    is a little over a century old. The history is described briefly, along with developments
    in X-ray sources and detectors. The fundamental processes involved in measuring
    diffraction patterns on area detectors, i.e. autoindexing, refining crystal and
    detector parameters, integrating the reflections themselves and putting the resultant
    measurements on to a common scale are discussed, with particular reference to
    the most commonly used software in the field.

    revolution'
  abstract: The pace at which cryo-EM is being adopted as a mainstream tool in structural
    biology has continued unabated over the past year. Initial successes in obtaining
    near-atomic resolution structures with cryo-EM were enabled to a large extent
    by advances in microscope and detector technology. Here, we review some of the
    complementary technical improvements that are helping sustain the cryo-EM revolution.
    We highlight advances in image processing that permit high resolution structure
    determination even in the presence of structural and conformational heterogeneity.
    We also review selected examples where biochemical strategies for membrane protein
    stabilization facilitate cryo-EM structure determination, and discuss emerging
    approaches for further improving the preparation of reliable plunge-frozen specimens.

  abstract: Multi-component molecular complexes are increasingly being tackled by
    structural biology, bringing X-ray crystallography into the purview of electron-microscopy
    (EM) studies. X-ray crystallography can utilize a low-resolution EM map for structure
    determination followed by phase extension to high resolution. Test studies have
    been conducted on five crystal structures of large molecular assemblies, in which
    EM maps are used as models for structure solution by molecular replacement (MR)
    using various standard MR packages such as *AMoRe*, *MOLREP* and *Phaser*. The
    results demonstrate that EM maps are viable models for molecular replacement.
    Possible difficulties in data analysis, such as the effects of the EM magnification
    error, and the effect of MR positional/rotational errors on phase extension are
    discussed.

  abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is increasingly becoming a mainstream
    technology for studying the architecture of cells, viruses and protein assemblies
    at molecular resolution. Recent developments in microscope design and imaging
    hardware, paired with enhanced image processing and automation capabilities, are
    poised to further advance the effectiveness of cryo-EM methods. These developments
    promise to increase the speed and extent of automation, and to improve the resolutions
    that may be achieved, making this technology useful to determine a wide variety
    of biological structures. Additionally, established modalities for structure determination,
    such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are
    being routinely integrated with cryo-EM density maps to achieve atomic-resolution
    models of complex, dynamic molecular assemblies. In this review, which is directed
    towards readers who are not experts in cryo-EM methodology, we provide an overview
    of emerging themes in the application of this technology to investigate diverse
    questions in biology and medicine. We discuss the ways in which these methods
    are being used to study structures of macromolecular assemblies that range in
    size from whole cells to small proteins. Finally, we include a description of
    how the structural information obtained by cryo-EM is deposited and archived in
    a publicly accessible database.

  container-title: Current Opinion in Microbiology
  page: 90 - 96
  volume: '34'
  note: 'Growth and development: Eukaryotes \* Growth and development: Prokaryotes'
  abstract: In most bacteria, cell division relies on the functions of an essential
    protein, FtsZ. FtsZ polymerizes at the future division site to form a ring-like
    structure, termed the Z-ring, that serves as a scaffold to recruit all other division
    proteins, and possibly generates force to constrict the cell. The scaffolding
    function of the Z-ring is well established, but the force generating function
    has recently been called into question. Additionally, new findings have demonstrated
    that the Z-ring is more directly linked to cell wall metabolism than simply recruiting
    enzymes to the division site. Here we review these advances and suggest that rather
    than generating a rate-limiting constrictive force, the Z-ring’s function may
    be redefined as an orchestrator of septum synthesis.

  abstract: Summary The assembly of the Z ring is the earliest step in bacterial cell
    division. In Escherichia coli this assembly requires either FtsA or ZipA which
    bind to a conserved, C-terminal 17 amino acid motif in FtsZ and to the membrane.
    The FtsZ–ZipA interaction is well characterized; however, nothing is known about
    the region of FtsA involved in the interaction with FtsZ even though the FtsA–FtsZ
    interaction is nearly ubiquitous in Eubacteria. FtsA is proposed to bind to the
    membrane through its conserved C-terminal amphiphatic helix before efficiently
    interacting with FtsZ. Based upon this model we designed a genetic screen to identify
    mutants specifically impaired for the FtsA–FtsZ interaction. The mutants obtained
    retain the ability to be targeted to the membrane but fail to be recruited to
    the Z ring or interact with FtsZ in the yeast two-hybrid system. These mutants
    do not complement an ftsA-depletion strain. Through this approach we have identified
    a region of FtsA containing some invariant residues which is required for binding
    to FtsZ. The results support our model that FtsA is targeted to the membrane before
    it interacts with FtsZ and demonstrates that this interaction plays an essential
    role in E. coli cell division.

  abstract: 'During cell division in Gram-negative bacteria, the cell envelope invaginates
    and constricts at the septum, eventually severing the cell into two compartments,
    and separating the replicated genetic materials. In Escherichia coli, at least
    nine essential gene products participate directly in septum formation: FtsA, FtsI,
    FtsL, FtsK, FtsN, FtsQ, FtsW, FtsZ and ZipA. All nine proteins have been localized
    to the septal ring, an equatorial ring structure at the division site. We used
    translational fusions to green fluorescent protein (GFP) to demonstrate that FtsQ,
    FtsL and FtsI localize to potential division sites in filamentous cells depleted
    of FtsN, but not in those depleted of FtsK. We also constructed translational
    fusions of FtsZ, FtsA, FtsQ, FtsL and FtsI to enhanced cyan or yellow fluorescent
    protein (ECFP or EYFP respectively), GFP variants with different fluorescence
    spectra. Examination of cells expressing different combinations of the fusions
    indicated that FtsA, FtsQ, FtsL and FtsI co-localize with FtsZ in filaments depleted
    of FtsN. These localization results support the model that E. coli cell division
    proteins assemble sequentially as a multimeric complex at the division site: first
    FtsZ, then FtsA and ZipA independently of each other, followed successively by
    FtsK, FtsQ, FtsL, FtsW, FtsI and FtsN.'

  title: The min system and nucleoid occlusion are not required for identifying the
    division site in bacillus subtilis but ensure its efficient utilization
  container-title: PLOS Genetics
  publisher: Public Library of Science
  page: '1-20'
  volume: '8'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: 'Author Summary How organisms regulate biological processes so that
    they occur at the correct place within the cell is a fundamental question in research.
    Spatial regulation of cell division is vital to ensure equal partitioning of DNA
    into newborn cells. Correct positioning of the division site at the cell centre
    in rod-shaped bacteria is generally believed to occur via the combined action
    of two factors: (i) nucleoid (chromosome) occlusion and (ii) a set of proteins
    known collectively as the Min system. The earliest stage in bacterial cell division
    is the assembly of a ring, called the Z ring, at the division site. Nucleoid occlusion
    and Min work by preventing Z ring assembly at all sites along the cell other than
    the cell centre. Here we make the surprising discovery that, in the absence of
    both these factors, Z rings are positioned correctly at the division site, but
    there is a delay in this process and it is less efficient. We propose that a separate
    mechanism identifies the division site at midcell in rod-shaped bacteria, and
    nucleoid occlusion and Min ensure that the Z ring forms there and only there,
    at the right time and every time.'

  container-title: Journal of bacteriology
  publisher: American Society for Microbiology
  page: '167-176'
  volume: '181'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Cell division in prokaryotes is mediated by the septal ring. In Escherichia
    coli, this organelle consists of several essential division proteins, including
    FtsZ, FtsA, and ZipA. To gain more insight into how the structure is assembled,
    we studied the interdependence of FtsZ, FtsA, and ZipA localization using both
    immunofluorescence and Gfp tagging techniques. To this end, we constructed a set
    of strains allowing us to determine the cellular location of each of these three
    proteins in cells from which one of the other two had been specifically depleted.
    Our results show that ZipA fails to accumulate in a ring shape in the absence
    of FtsZ. Conversely, depletion of ZipA does not abolish formation of FtsZ rings
    but leads to a significant reduction in the number of rings per unit of cell mass.
    In addition, ZipA does not appear to require FtsA for assembly into the septal
    ring and vice versa. It is suggested that septal ring formation starts by assembly
    of the FtsZ ring, after which ZipA and FtsA join this structure in a mutually
    independent fashion through direct interactions with the FtsZ protein.

  container-title: Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences
  page: '4245-4273'
  volume: '76'
  issue: '21'
  abstract: Molecular self-organziation, also regarded as pattern formation, is crucial
    for the correct distribution of cellular content. The processes leading to spatiotemporal
    patterns often involve a multitude of molecules interacting in complex networks,
    so that only very few cellular pattern-forming systems can be regarded as well
    understood. Due to its compositional simplicity, the Escherichia coli MinCDE system
    has, thus, become a paradigm for protein pattern formation. This biological reaction
    diffusion system spatiotemporally positions the division machinery in E. coli
    and is closely related to ParA-type ATPases involved in most aspects of spatiotemporal
    organization in bacteria. The ATPase MinD and the ATPase-activating protein MinE
    self-organize on the membrane as a reaction matrix. In vivo, these two proteins
    typically oscillate from pole-to-pole, while in vitro they can form a variety
    of distinct patterns. MinC is a passenger protein supposedly operating as a downstream
    cue of the system, coupling it to the division machinery. The MinCDE system has
    helped to extract not only the principles underlying intracellular patterns, but
    also how they are shaped by cellular boundaries. Moreover, it serves as a model
    to investigate how patterns can confer information through specific and non-specific
    interactions with other molecules. Here, we review how the three Min proteins
    self-organize to form patterns, their response to geometric boundaries, and how
    these patterns can in turn induce patterns of other molecules, focusing primarily
    on experimental approaches and developments.

  title: Nucleoid occlusion protein noc recruits dna to the bacterial cell membrane.
  container-title: EMBO J
  page: '491-501'
  volume: '34'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: To proliferate efficiently, cells must co-ordinate division with chromosome
    segregation. In Bacillus subtilis, the nucleoid occlusion protein Noc binds to
    specific DNA sequences (NBSs) scattered around the chromosome and helps to protect
    genomic integrity by coupling the initiation of division to the progression of
    chromosome replication and segregation. However, how it inhibits division has
    remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Noc associates with the cell membrane
    via an N-terminal amphipathic helix, which is necessary for function. Importantly,
    the membrane-binding affinity of this helix is weak and requires the assembly
    of nucleoprotein complexes, thus establishing a mechanism for DNA-dependent activation
    of Noc. Furthermore, division inhibition by Noc requires recruitment of NBS DNA
    to the cell membrane and is dependent on its ability to bind DNA and membrane
    simultaneously. Indeed, Noc production in a heterologous system is sufficient
    for recruitment of chromosomal DNA to the membrane. Our results suggest a simple
    model in which the formation of large membrane-associated nucleoprotein complexes
    physically occludes assembly of the division machinery.

    complex called the divisome. Most of the divisome proteins have been identified,
    but how they assemble onto the Z ring scaffold to form the divisome and work together
    to synthesize the septum is not well understood. In this review, we summarize
    the latest findings on divisome assembly and activation as well as provide our
    perspective on how these two processes might be regulated.

  note: Cell regulation
  abstract: Cell division in bacteria requires the construction of two new polar caps
    for the daughter cells. To constrict the cell membrane and build these new surface
    layers, bacteria employ a multiprotein machine called the divisome. Over the years,
    most of the essential division proteins have been identified and localized to
    the ring-like divisome apparatus. The challenge now is to determine the molecular
    function of these factors, how they cooperate to bring about the dramatic transformation
    of the mother cell envelope, and what coordinates their activity with other major
    cell cycle events. In this review, we discuss recent progress in these areas with
    an emphasis on results from the model organisms Escherichia coli and Bacillus
    subtilis.

  title: MinCD cell division proteins form alternating copolymeric cytomotive filaments
  container-title: Nature Communications
  page: '5341'
  volume: '5'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: During bacterial cell division, filaments of the tubulin-like protein
    FtsZ assemble at midcell to form the cytokinetic Z-ring. Its positioning is regulated
    by the oscillation of MinCDE proteins. MinC is activated by MinD through an unknown
    mechanism and prevents Z-ring assembly anywhere but midcell. Here, using X-ray
    crystallography, electron microscopy and in vivo analyses, we show that MinD activates
    MinC by forming a new class of alternating copolymeric filaments that show similarity
    to eukaryotic septin filaments. A non-polymerizing mutation in MinD causes aberrant
    cell division in Escherichia coli. MinCD copolymers bind to membrane, interact
    with FtsZ and are disassembled by MinE. Imaging a functional msfGFP-MinC fusion
    protein in MinE-deleted cells reveals filamentous structures. EM imaging of our
    reconstitution of the MinCD-FtsZ interaction on liposome surfaces reveals a plausible
    mechanism for regulation of FtsZ ring assembly by MinCD copolymers.

  container-title: Molecular Microbiology
  page: '278-289'
  volume: '78'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Summary Mycoplasma genomes exhibit an impressively low amount of genes
    involved in cell division and some species even lack the ftsZ gene, which is found
    widespread in the microbial world and is considered essential for cell division
    by binary fission. We constructed a Mycoplasma genitalium ftsZ null mutant by
    gene replacement to investigate the role of this gene and the presence of alternative
    cell division mechanisms in this minimal bacterium. Our results demonstrate that
    ftsZ is non-essential for cell growth and reveal that, in the absence of the FtsZ
    protein, M. genitalium can manage feasible cell divisions and cytokinesis using
    the force generated by its motile machinery. This is an alternative mechanism,
    completely independent of the FtsZ protein, to perform cell division by binary
    fission in a microorganism. We also propose that the mycoplasma cytoskeleton,
    a complex network of proteins involved in many aspects of the biology of these
    microorganisms, may have taken over the function of many genes involved in cell
    division, allowing their loss in the regressive evolution of the streamlined mycoplasma
    genomes.

  title-short: Bacterial cell division
  container-title: Nature Reviews Microbiology
  page: '642-653'
  volume: '7'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: The first recognizable event in bacterial cell division is the assembly
    of FtsZ into a ring-like structure at mid-cell. This Z ring serves as a scaffold
    for the assembly of the division machinery and contracts throughout division,
    guiding the synthesis of the nascent septum.FtsZ is the ancestral homologue of
    tubulin and assembles cooperatively, in a GTP-dependent manner, into longitudinal
    protofilaments similar to those of αβ-tubulin. Although the polymerization of
    FtsZ in vitro has been studied extensively, little is known about the architecture
    of the polymers that make up the Z ring in vivo.Importantly, the concentration
    of FtsZ in vivo is greatly in excess of the critical concentration for assembly.
    Despite this, the intracellular concentration of FtsZ does not vary greatly during
    the cell cycle. The initiation of cell division is instead regulated both spatially
    and temporally at the level of Z ring assembly, by an array of accessory proteins
    that can modulate the polymerization of FtsZ.FtsZ is a cytoplasmic protein, but
    it must be tethered to the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane to form the
    Z ring. This is achieved primarily by the action of FtsA, which is widely conserved
    and contains an amphipathic membrane-targeting sequence. Where present, ZipA,
    an integral membrane protein, can also allow Z ring assembly and, along with ZapA,
    also contributes to the stability of the Z ring.Other, early-assembling regulators,
    such as ZapB and SepF, potentially play a part in organizing the ultrastructure
    of the Z ring and, although it is not normally essential, SepF seems to contribute
    to this process and might also be able to act as a membrane tether.The Z ring
    is not a static structure. The polymers that constitute the Z ring are in a state
    of flux, with subunits rapidly exchanging between the polymer and the cytoplasmic
    pool. This turnover is stimulated by GTP hydrolysis and is regulated by the antagonistic
    behaviour of many non-essential proteins, including ZapA, extra Z rings A (EzrA)
    and ClpX.Several regulatory proteins also render the Z ring responsive to variations
    in the cell cycle by taking advantage of the accessibility of subunits that is
    afforded by the dynamic nature of the Z ring. UgtP delays cell division by destabilizing
    the Z ring, and the induction of SulA during the SOS response prevents new Z ring
    assembly and disassembles existing Z rings. In addition, during sporulation, mother
    cell inhibitor of FtsZ (MciZ) prevents inappropriate cell division once the process
    has been initiated.

  abstract: The last three decades have witnessed an explosion of discoveries about
    the mechanistic details of binary fission in model bacteria such as Escherichia
    coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Caulobacter crescentus. This was made possible not
    only by advances in microscopy that helped answer questions about cell biology
    but also by clever genetic manipulations that directly and easily tested specific
    hypotheses. More recently, research using understudied organisms, or nonmodel
    systems, has revealed several alternate mechanistic strategies that bacteria use
    to divide and propagate. In this review, we highlight new findings and compare
    these strategies to cell division mechanisms elucidated in model organisms.

  abstract: RecQ DNA helicases are critical enzymes for the maintenance of genome
    integrity. Here, we determined the first DNA complex structures, to our knowledge,
    of the human RECQ1 helicase. These structures provide new insight into the RecQ
    helicase mechanism of DNA tracking, strand separation, strand annealing, and Holliday
    junction (HJ) branch migration. We identified a surface region in the winged-helix
    domain of RECQ1 that is important for both dsDNA recognition and HJ resolution,
    and we used a combination of biochemical, analytical ultracentrifugation, and
    EM experiments to begin elucidating the molecular basis of the distinct HJ resolution
    activities of human RecQ helicases.RecQ helicases are a widely conserved family
    of ATP-dependent motors with diverse roles in nearly every aspect of bacterial
    and eukaryotic genome maintenance. However, the physical mechanisms by which RecQ
    helicases recognize and process specific DNA replication and repair intermediates
    are largely unknown. Here, we solved crystal structures of the human RECQ1 helicase
    in complexes with tailed-duplex DNA and ssDNA. The structures map the interactions
    of the ssDNA tail and the branch point along the helicase and Zn-binding domains,
    which, together with reported structures of other helicases, define the catalytic
    stages of helicase action. We also identify a strand-separating pin, which (uniquely
    in RECQ1) is buttressed by the protein dimer interface. A duplex DNA-binding surface
    on the C-terminal domain is shown to play a role in DNA unwinding, strand annealing,
    and Holliday junction (HJ) branch migration. We have combined EM and analytical
    ultracentrifugation approaches to show that RECQ1 can form what appears to be
    a flat, homotetrameric complex and propose that RECQ1 tetramers are involved in
    HJ recognition. This tetrameric arrangement suggests a platform for coordinated
    activity at the advancing and receding duplexes of an HJ during branch migration.

  abstract: RecQ family helicases catalyze critical genome maintenance reactions in
    bacterial and eukaryotic cells, playing key roles in several DNA metabolic processes.
    Mutations in recQ genes are linked to genome instability and human disease. To
    define the physical basis of RecQ enzyme function, we have determined a 1.8 Å
    resolution crystal structure of the catalytic core of Escherichia coli RecQ in
    its unbound form and a 2.5 Å resolution structure of the core bound to the ATP
    analog ATPγS. The RecQ core comprises four conserved subdomains; two of these
    combine to form its helicase region, while the others form unexpected Zn2+-binding
    and winged-helix motifs. The structures reveal the molecular basis of missense
    mutations that cause Bloom’s syndrome, a human RecQ-associated disease. Finally,
    based on findings from the structures, we propose a mechanism for RecQ activity
    that could explain its functional coordination with topoisomerase III.

  abstract: Lentiviral vectors (LV) have seen considerably increase in use as gene
    therapy vectors for the treatment of acquired and inherited diseases. This review
    presents the state of the art of the production of these vectors with particular
    emphasis on their large-scale production for clinical purposes. In contrast to
    oncoretroviral vectors, which are produced using stable producer cell lines, clinical-grade
    LV are in most of the cases produced by transient transfection of 293 or 293T
    cells grown in cell factories. However, more recent developments, also, tend to
    use hollow fiber reactor, suspension culture processes, and the implementation
    of stable producer cell lines. As is customary for the biotech industry, rather
    sophisticated downstream processing protocols have been established to remove
    any undesirable process-derived contaminant, such as plasmid or host cell DNA
    or host cell proteins. This review compares published large-scale production and
    purification processes of LV and presents their process performances. Furthermore,
    developments in the domain of stable cell lines and their way to the use of production
    vehicles of clinical material will be presented.

  abstract: Precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is a critical step in the
    posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, providing significant expansion
    of the functional proteome of eukaryotic organisms with limited gene numbers.
    Split eukaryotic genes contain intervening sequences or introns disrupting protein-coding
    exons, and intron removal occurs by repeated assembly of a large and highly dynamic
    ribonucleoprotein complex termed the spliceosome, which is composed of five small
    nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5. Biochemical studies
    over the past 10 years have allowed the isolation as well as compositional, functional,
    and structural analysis of splicing complexes at distinct stages along the spliceosome
    cycle. The average human gene contains eight exons and seven introns, producing
    an average of three or more alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms. Recent high-throughput
    sequencing studies indicate that 100% of human genes produce at least two alternative
    mRNA isoforms. Mechanisms of alternative splicing include RNA?protein interactions
    of splicing factors with regulatory sites termed silencers or enhancers, RNA?RNA
    base-pairing interactions, or chromatin-based effects that can change or determine
    splicing patterns. Disease-causing mutations can often occur in splice sites near
    intron borders or in exonic or intronic RNA regulatory silencer or enhancer elements,
    as well as in genes that encode splicing factors. Together, these studies provide
    mechanistic insights into how spliceosome assembly, dynamics, and catalysis occur;
    how alternative splicing is regulated and evolves; and how splicing can be disrupted
    by cis- and trans-acting mutations leading to disease states. These findings make
    the spliceosome an attractive new target for small-molecule, antisense, and genome-editing
    therapeutic interventions.

  title: Protein folding by nmr
  container-title: Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
  page: '52-77'
  volume: '100'
  abstract: Protein folding is a highly complex process proceeding through a number
    of disordered and partially folded nonnative states with various degrees of structural
    organization. These transiently and sparsely populated species on the protein
    folding energy landscape play crucial roles in driving folding toward the native
    conformation, yet some of these nonnative states may also serve as precursors
    for protein misfolding and aggregation associated with a range of devastating
    diseases, including neuro-degeneration, diabetes and cancer. Therefore, in vivo
    protein folding is often reshaped co- and post-translationally through interactions
    with the ribosome, molecular chaperones and/or other cellular components. Owing
    to developments in instrumentation and methodology, solution NMR spectroscopy
    has emerged as the central experimental approach for the detailed characterization
    of the complex protein folding processes in vitro and in vivo. NMR relaxation
    dispersion and saturation transfer methods provide the means for a detailed characterization
    of protein folding kinetics and thermodynamics under native-like conditions, as
    well as modeling high-resolution structures of weakly populated short-lived conformational
    states on the protein folding energy landscape. Continuing development of isotope
    labeling strategies and NMR methods to probe high molecular weight protein assemblies,
    along with advances of in-cell NMR, have recently allowed protein folding to be
    studied in the context of ribosome-nascent chain complexes and molecular chaperones,
    and even inside living cells. Here we review solution NMR approaches to investigate
    the protein folding energy landscape, and discuss selected applications of NMR
    methodology to studying protein folding in vitro and in vivo. Together, these
    examples highlight a vast potential of solution NMR in providing atomistic insights
    into molecular mechanisms of protein folding and homeostasis in health and disease.

  container-title: Nature Communications
  page: '100'
  volume: '1'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Protein interactions inside the human body are expected to differ from
    the situation in vitro. This is crucial when investigating protein functions or
    developing new drugs. In this study, we present a sample-efficient, free-solution
    method, termed microscale thermophoresis, that is capable of analysing interactions
    of proteins or small molecules in biological liquids such as blood serum or cell
    lysate. The technique is based on the thermophoresis of molecules, which provides
    information about molecule size, charge and hydration shell. We validated the
    method using immunologically relevant systems including human interferon gamma
    and the interaction of calmodulin with calcium. The affinity of the small-molecule
    inhibitor quercetin to its kinase PKA was determined in buffer and human serum,
    revealing a 400-fold reduced affinity in serum. This information about the influence
    of the biological matrix may allow to make more reliable conclusions on protein
    functionality, and may facilitate more efficient drug development.

  volume: '26'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Wnt signaling plays fundamental roles in organogenesis, tissue regeneration
    and cancer, but high-resolution structural information of mammalian Wnt proteins
    is lacking. We solved a 2.8-Åresolution crystal structure of human Wnt3 in complex
    with mouse Frizzled 8 Cys-rich domain (CRD). Wnt3 grabs the receptor in a manner
    very similar to that found in Xenopus Wnt8 complexed with the same receptor. Unlike
    Xenopus Wnt8-bound CRD, however, Wnt3-bound CRD formed a symmetrical dimer in
    the crystal by exchanging the tip of the unsaturated acyl chain attached to each
    Wnt3, confirming the ability of Wnt and Frizzled CRD to form a 2:2 complex. The
    hypervariable ‘linker’region of Wnt3 formed a β-hairpin protrusion opposite from
    the Frizzled binding interface, consistent with its proposed role in the coreceptor
    recognition. Direct binding between this segment and the Wnt coreceptor LRP6 was
    confirmed, enabling us to build a structural model of the Wnt–Frizzled–LRP6 ternary
    complex.

  volume: '1859'

  note: 20th European Bioenergetics Conference
  abstract: Cytochrome c oxidase is a remarkable energy transducer that seems to work
    almost purely by Coulombic principles without the need for significant protein
    conformational changes. In recent years it has become possible to follow key partial
    reactions of the catalytic cycle in real time, both with respect to electron and
    proton movements. These experiments have largely set the stage for the proton
    pump mechanism. The structures of the catalytic binuclear heme‑copper site that
    is common to the huge family of heme‑copper oxidases, are today well understood
    throughout the catalytic cycle of oxygen reduction to water based on both spectroscopic
    studies and quantum chemical calculations. Here, we briefly review this progress,
    and add some recent details into how the proton pump mechanism is protected from
    failure by leakage.

  abstract: In respiring organisms the major energy transduction flux employs the
    transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient as a physical link between exergonic
    redox reactions and endergonic ADP phosphorylation. Establishing the gradient
    involves electrogenic, transmembrane H+ translocation by the membrane-embedded
    respiratory complexes. Among others, Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase)
    is the most structurally complex and functionally enigmatic respiratory enzyme;
    its molecular mechanism is as yet unknown. Here we highlight recent progress and
    discuss the catalytic events during Complex I turnover in relation to their role
    in energy conversion and to the enzyme structure.

  title: The connection between inner membrane topology and mitochondrial function
  container-title: Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology
  page: '51-57'
  volume: '62'
  abstract: The mitochondrial inner membrane has a complex and dynamic structure that
    plays an important role in the function of this organelle. The internal compartments
    called cristae are created by processes that are just beginning to be understood.
    Crista size and morphology influence the internal diffusion of solutes and the
    surface area of the inner membrane, which is home to critical membrane proteins
    including ATP synthase and electron transport chain complexes; metabolite and
    ion transporters including the adenine nucleotide translocase, the calcium uniporter
    (MCU), and the sodium/calcium exchanger (NCLX); and many more. Here we provide
    a brief overview of what is known about crista structure and formation, and discuss
    mitochondrial function in the context of that structure. We also suggest that
    mathematical modeling of mitochondria that incorporates accurate information about
    the organelle’s internal architecture can lead to a better understanding of its
    diverse functions. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled ‘Calcium Signalling
    in Heart’.

  abstract: Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is crucial for respiration
    in many aerobic organisms. In mitochondria, it oxidizes NADH from the tricarboxylic
    acid cycle and ?-oxidation, reduces ubiquinone, and transports protons across
    the inner membrane, contributing to the proton-motive force. It is also a major
    contributor to cellular production of reactive oxygen species. The redox reaction
    of complex I is catalyzed in the hydrophilic domain; it comprises NADH oxidation
    by a flavin mononucleotide, intramolecular electron transfer along a chain of
    iron-sulfur clusters, and ubiquinone reduction. Redox-coupled proton translocation
    in the membrane domain requires long-range energy transfer through the protein
    complex, and the molecular mechanisms that couple the redox and proton-transfer
    half-reactions are currently unknown. This review evaluates extant data on the
    mechanisms of energy transduction and superoxide production by complex I, discusses
    contemporary mechanistic models, and explores how mechanistic studies may contribute
    to understanding the roles of complex I dysfunctions in human diseases.

  title: Structure and function of mitochondrial complex i
  container-title: Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics
  page: '902-914'
  volume: '1857'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: Proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the largest
    and most complicated enzyme of the respiratory chain. Fourteen central subunits
    represent the minimal form of complex I and can be assigned to functional modules
    for NADH oxidation, ubiquinone reduction, and proton pumping. In addition, the
    mitochondrial enzyme comprises some 30 accessory subunits surrounding the central
    subunits that are not directly associated with energy conservation. Complex I
    is known to release deleterious oxygen radicals (ROS) and its dysfunction has
    been linked to a number of hereditary and degenerative diseases. We here review
    recent progress in structure determination, and in understanding the role of accessory
    subunits and functional analysis of mitochondrial complex I. For the central subunits,
    structures provide insight into the arrangement of functional modules including
    the substrate binding sites, redox-centers and putative proton channels and pump
    sites. Only for two of the accessory subunits, detailed structures are available.
    Nevertheless, many of them could be localized in the overall structure of complex
    I, but most of these assignments have to be considered tentative. Strikingly,
    redox reactions and proton pumping machinery are spatially completely separated
    and the site of reduction for the hydrophobic substrate ubiquinone is found deeply
    buried in the hydrophilic domain of the complex. The X-ray structure of complex
    I from Yarrowia lipolytica provides clues supporting the previously proposed two-state
    stabilization change mechanism, in which ubiquinone redox chemistry induces conformational
    states and thereby drives proton pumping. The same structural rearrangements may
    explain the active/deactive transition of complex I implying an integrated mechanistic
    model for energy conversion and regulation. This article is part of a Special
    Issue entitled Respiratory complex I, edited by Volker Zickermann and Ulrich Brandt.

  abstract: Respiration is one of the most basic features of living organisms, and
    the electron transport chain complexes are probably the most complicated protein
    system in mitochondria. Complex-IV is the terminal enzyme of the electron transport
    chain, existing either as randomly scattered complexes or as a component of supercomplexes.
    NDUFA4 was previously assumed as a subunit of complex-I, but recent biochemical
    data suggested it may be a subunit of complex-IV. However, no structural evidence
    supporting this notion was available till now. Here we obtained the 3.3 Åresolution
    structure of complex-IV derived from the human supercomplex I1III2IV1 and assigned
    the NDUFA4 subunit into complex-IV. Intriguingly, NDUFA4 lies exactly at the dimeric
    interface observed in previously reported crystal structures of complex-IV homodimer
    which would preclude complex-IV dimerization. Combining previous structural and
    biochemical data shown by us and other groups, we propose that the intact complex-IV
    is a monomer containing 14 subunits.

  title: Structure of the membrane domain of respiratory complex i
  container-title: Nature
  page: '414-420'
  volume: '476'
  issue: '7361'
  abstract: Complex I is the first and largest enzyme of the respiratory chain, coupling
    electron transfer between NADH and ubiquinone to the translocation of four protons
    across the membrane. It has a central role in cellular energy production and has
    been implicated in many human neurodegenerative diseases. The L-shaped enzyme
    consists of hydrophilic and membrane domains. Previously, we determined the structure
    of the hydrophilic domain. Here we report the crystal structure of the Esherichia
    coli complex I membrane domain at 3.0 Åresolution. It includes six subunits, NuoL,
    NuoM, NuoN, NuoA, NuoJ and NuoK, with 55 transmembrane helices. The fold of the
    homologous antiporter-like subunits L, M and N is novel, with two inverted structural
    repeats of five transmembrane helices arranged, unusually, face-to-back. Each
    repeat includes a discontinuous transmembrane helix and forms half of a channel
    across the membrane. A network of conserved polar residues connects the two half-channels,
    completing the proton translocation pathway. Unexpectedly, lysines rather than
    carboxylate residues act as the main elements of the proton pump in these subunits.
    The fourth probable proton-translocation channel is at the interface of subunits
    N, K, J and A. The structure indicates that proton translocation in complex I,
    uniquely, involves coordinated conformational changes in six symmetrical structural
    elements.

  container-title: Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics
  page: '1096-1109'
  volume: '1757'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: The single, simple concept that natural selection adjusts distances between
    redox cofactors goes a long way towards encompassing natural electron transfer
    protein design. Distances are short or long as required to direct or insulate
    promiscuously tunneling single electrons. Along a chain, distances are usually
    14 Åor less. Shorter distances are needed to allow climbing of added energetic
    barriers at paired-electron catalytic centers in which substrate and the required
    number of cofactors form a compact cluster. When there is a short-circuit danger,
    distances between shorting centers are relatively long. Distances much longer
    than 14Åwill support only very slow electron tunneling, but could act as high
    impedance signals useful in regulation. Tunneling simulations of the respiratory
    complexes provide clear illustrations of this simple engineering.

  title: Determination of cell membrane capacitance and conductance via optically
    induced electrokinetics
  container-title: Biophysical Journal
  page: '1531-1539'
  volume: '113'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: Cell membrane capacitance and conductance are key pieces of intrinsic
    information correlated with the cellular dielectric parameters and morphology
    of the plasma membrane; these parameters have been used as electrophysiological
    biomarkers to characterize cellular phenotype and state, and they have many associated
    clinical applications. Here, we present our work on the non-invasive determination
    of cell membrane capacitance and conductance by an optically activated microfluidics
    chip. The model for determining the cell membrane capacitance and conductance
    was established by a single layer of the shell-core polarization model. Three-dimensional
    finite-element analyses of the positive and negative optically induced dielectrophoresis
    forces generated by the projected light arrays of spots were performed, thus providing
    a theoretical validation of the feasibility of this approach. Then, the crossover
    frequency spectra for four typical types of cells (Raji cells, MCF-7 cells, HEK293
    cells, and K562 cells) were experimentally investigated by using a micro-vision
    based motion-tracking technique. The different responses of these cells to the
    positive and negative ODEP forces were studied under four different liquid conductivities
    by automatic observation and tracking of the cellular trajectory and texture during
    the cells’translation. The cell membrane capacitance and conductance were determined
    from the curve-fitted spectra, which were 11.1 $\pm$0.9 mF/m2 and 782 $\pm$32
    S/m2, respectively, for Raji cells, 11.5 $\pm$0.8 mF/m2 and 114 $\pm$28 S/m2 for
    MCF-7 cells, 9.0 $\pm$0.9 mF/m2 and 187 $\pm$22 S/m2 for HEK293 cells, and 10.2
    $\pm$0.7 mF/m2 and 879 $\pm$24 S/m2 for K562 cells. Furthermore, as an application
    of this technique, the membrane capacitances of MCF-7 cells treated with four
    different concentrations of drugs were acquired. This technique introduces a determination
    of cell membrane capacitance and conductance that yields statistically significant
    data while allowing information from individual cells to be obtained in a non-invasive
    manner.

  title: Revisiting mitochondrial pH with an improved algorithm for calibration of

    h+ ions and warrants further studies of organellar pH
  container-title: PLOS ONE

  abstract: Fluorescence measurements of pH and other analytes in the cell rely on
    accurate calibrations, but these have routinely used algorithms that inadequately
    describe the properties of indicators. Here, we have established a more accurate
    method for calibrating and analyzing data obtained using the ratiometric probe
    5(6)-carboxy-SNARF-1. We tested the implications of novel approach to measurements
    of pH in yeast mitochondria, a compartment containing a small number of free H+
    ions. Our findings demonstrate that 5(6)-carboxy-SNARF-1 interacts with H+ ions
    inside the mitochondria in an anticooperative manner (Hill coefficient n of 0.5)
    and the apparent pH inside the mitochondria is  0.5 unit lower than had been generally
    assumed. This result, at odds with the current consensus on the mechanism of energy
    generation in the mitochondria, is in better agreement with theoretical considerations
    and warrants further studies of organellar pH.

    mitochondria</span>
  container-title: Biochemical Journal
  page: '1147-1162'
  volume: '105'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: 1\. Pulses of acidity of the outer aqueous phase of rat liver mitochondrial
    suspensions induced by pulses of respiration are due to the translocation of H+
    (or OH−) ions across the osmotic barrier (M phase) of the cristae membrane and
    cannot be attributed to the formation (with acid production) of a chemical intermediate
    that subsequently decomposes. 2. The effective quantity of protons translocated
    per bivalent reducing equivalent passing through the succinate-oxidizing and β-hydroxybutyrate-oxidizing
    spans of the respiratory chain are very close to 4 and 6 respectively. These quotients
    are constant between pH5·5 and 8·5 and are independent of changes in the ionic
    composition of the mitochondrial suspension medium provided that the conditions
    permit the accurate experimental measurement of the proton translocation. 3. Apparent
    changes in the →H+/O quotients may be induced by conditions preventing the occurrence
    of the usual backlash; these apparent changes of →H+/O are attributable to a very
    fast electrically driven component of the decay of the acid pulses that is not
    included in the experimental extrapolations. 4. Apparent changes in the →H+/O
    quotients may also be induced by the presence of anions, such as succinate, malonate
    and phosphate, or by cations such as Na+. These apparent changes of →H+/O are
    due to an increase in the rate of the pH-driven decay of the acid pulses. 5. The
    uncoupling agents, 2,4-dinitrophenol, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone
    and gramicidin increase the effective proton conductance of the M phase and thus
    increase the rate of decay of the respiration-driven acid pulses, but do not change
    the initial →H+/O quotients. The increase in effective proton conductance of the
    M phase caused by these uncouplers accounts quantitatively for their uncoupling
    action; and the fact that the initial →H+/O quotients are unchanged shows that
    uncoupler-sensitive chemical intermediates do not exist between the respiratory-chain
    system and the effective proton-translocating mechanism. 6. Stoicheiometric acid–base
    changes associated with the activity of the regions of the respiratory chain on
    the oxygen side of the rotenone- and antimycin A-sensitive sites gives experimental
    support for a suggested configuration of loop 3.
