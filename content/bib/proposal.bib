	abstract = {Polycomb repressive complexes-1 and -2 (PRC1 and 2) silence developmental genes in a spatiotemporal manner during embryogenesis. How Polycomb group (PcG) proteins orchestrate down-regulation of target genes upon differentiation, however, remains elusive. Here, by differentiating embryonic stem cells into embryoid bodies, we reveal a crucial role for the PCGF1-containing variant PRC1 complex (PCGF1-PRC1) to mediate differentiation-associated down-regulation of a group of genes. Upon differentiation cues, transcription is down-regulated at these genes, in association with PCGF1-PRC1-mediated deposition of histone H2AK119 mono-ubiquitination (H2AK119ub1) and PRC2 recruitment. In the absence of PCGF1-PRC1, both H2AK119ub1 deposition and PRC2 recruitment are disrupted, leading to aberrant expression of target genes. PCGF1-PRC1 is, therefore, required for initiation and consolidation of PcG-mediated gene repression during differentiation.},

@article{Kondo-2016,
	abstract = {Combinatorial associations between distinct chromatin domains, namely promoters and cis-regulatory elements, determine transcriptional status. Developmental regulatory gene expression, mostly regulated by the Polycomb/Trithorax group of chromatin regulators, is often temporally and spatially specific, and sometimes changes repeatedly within the same cell lineage. Dysregulated expression of these genes causes morphological and/or functional disorganization of tissues and organs. Therefore, maintenance of both the active and negative states of transcription is equally important. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of transition between transcriptional status of developmental regulators, including complex processes for enhancer activation and promoter--enhancer association. In particular, we propose testable models in which Polycomb group factors contribute to promoter--enhancer associations and thus proper gene expression.},

@article{Bartosovic-2021,
	abstract = {In contrast to single-cell approaches for measuring gene expression and DNA accessibility, single-cell methods for analyzing histone modifications are limited by low sensitivity and throughput. Here, we combine the CUT\&Tag technology, developed to measure bulk histone modifications, with droplet-based single-cell library preparation to produce high-quality single-cell data on chromatin modifications. We apply single-cell CUT\&Tag (scCUT\&Tag) to tens of thousands of cells of the mouse central nervous system and probe histone modifications characteristic of active promoters, enhancers and gene bodies (H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K36me3) and inactive regions (H3K27me3). These scCUT\&Tag profiles were sufficient to determine cell identity and deconvolute regulatory principles such as promoter bivalency, spreading of H3K4me3 and promoter--enhancer connectivity. We also used scCUT\&Tag to investigate the single-cell chromatin occupancy of transcription factor OLIG2 and the cohesin complex component RAD21. Our results indicate that analysis of histone modifications and transcription factor occupancy at single-cell resolution provides unique insights into epigenomic landscapes in the central nervous system.},

@article{Gao-2014,
	abstract = {Naturally occurring variations of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) comprise a core assembly of Polycomb group proteins and additional factors that include, surprisingly, autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2). Although AUTS2 is often disrupted in patients with neuronal disorders, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis is unclear. We investigated the role of AUTS2 as part of a previously identified PRC1 complex (PRC1--AUTS2), and in the context of neurodevelopment. In contrast to the canonical role of PRC1 in gene repression, PRC1--AUTS2 activates transcription. Biochemical studies demonstrate that the CK2 component of PRC1--AUTS2 neutralizes PRC1 repressive activity, whereas AUTS2-mediated recruitment of P300 leads to gene activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrated that AUTS2 regulates neuronal gene expression through promoter association. Conditional targeting of Auts2 in the mouse central nervous system (CNS) leads to various developmental defects. These findings reveal a natural means of subverting PRC1 activity, linking key epigenetic modulators with neuronal functions and diseases.},

@article{Zhou-2022,
	abstract = {Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) are histone-modifying and -binding complexes that mediate the formation of facultative heterochromatin and are required for silencing of developmental genes and maintenance of cell fate1--3. Multiple pathways of RNA decay work together to establish and maintain heterochromatin in fission yeast, including a recently identified role for a conserved RNA-degradation complex known as the rixosome or RIX1 complex4--6. Whether RNA degradation also has a role in the stability of mammalian heterochromatin remains unknown. Here we show that the rixosome contributes to silencing of many Polycomb targets in human cells. The rixosome associates with human PRC complexes and is enriched at promoters of Polycomb target genes. Depletion of either the rixosome or Polycomb results in accumulation of paused and elongating RNA polymerase at Polycomb target genes. We identify point mutations in the RING1B subunit of PRC1 that disrupt the interaction between PRC1 and the rixosome and result in diminished silencing, suggesting that direct recruitment of the rixosome to chromatin is required for silencing. Finally, we show that the RNA endonuclease and kinase activities of the rixosome and the downstream XRN2 exoribonuclease, which degrades RNAs with 5′monophosphate groups generated by the rixosome, are required for silencing. Our findings suggest that rixosomal degradation of nascent RNA is conserved from fission yeast to human, with a primary role in RNA degradation at facultative heterochromatin in human cells.},

@article{Wani-2016,
	abstract = {The genomes of metazoa are organized at multiple scales. Many proteins that regulate genome architecture, including Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, form subnuclear structures. Deciphering mechanistic links between protein organization and chromatin architecture requires precise description and mechanistic perturbations of both. Using super-resolution microscopy, here we show that PcG proteins are organized into hundreds of nanoscale protein clusters. We manipulated PcG clusters by disrupting the polymerization activity of the sterile alpha motif (SAM) of the PcG protein Polyhomeotic (Ph) or by increasing Ph levels. Ph with mutant SAM disrupts clustering of endogenous PcG complexes and chromatin interactions while elevating Ph level increases cluster number and chromatin interactions. These effects can be captured by molecular simulations based on a previously described chromatin polymer model. Both perturbations also alter gene expression. Organization of PcG proteins into small, abundant clusters on chromatin through Ph SAM polymerization activity may shape genome architecture through chromatin interactions.},

@article{Lau-2017,
	abstract = {Histone proteins wrap around DNA to form nucleosomes that package metazoan DNA into the nucleus. Chromatin compaction is also believed to be critical for the repression of homeotic genes by the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) during development. Lau et al. used mutagenesis and expression analyses to examine this gene silencing mechanism. Altering the PRC1 compaction region affected transcriptional repression and patterning of the mouse body axis. Thus, chromatin compaction may drive the stable and heritable silencing of genes involved in body patterning. Science, this issue p. 1081 Nucleosome compaction by PRC1 is likely necessary for maintaining gene repression during development. Nucleosomes play important structural and regulatory roles by tightly wrapping the DNA that constitutes the metazoan genome. The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins modulate nucleosomes to maintain repression of key developmental genes, including Hox genes whose temporal and spatial expression is tightly regulated to guide patterning of the anterior-posterior body axis. CBX2, a component of the mammalian Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), contains a compaction region that has the biochemically defined activity of bridging adjacent nucleosomes. Here, we demonstrate that a functional compaction region is necessary for proper body patterning, because mutating this region leads to homeotic transformations similar to those observed with PcG loss-of-function mutations. We propose that CBX2-driven nucleosome compaction is a key mechanism by which PcG proteins maintain gene silencing during mouse development.},

PRCs repress transcription through histone modifications and chromatin compaction, but their roles in neuronal subtype diversification are poorly defined. We found that PRC1 is essential for the specification of segmentally restricted spinal motor neuron (MN) subtypes, while PRC2 activity is dispensable to maintain MN positional identities during terminal differentiation. Mutation of the core PRC1 component \textit{Ring1} in mice leads to increased chromatin accessibility and ectopic expression of a broad variety of fates determinants, including \textit{Hox} transcription factors, while neuronal class-specific features are maintained. Loss of MN subtype identities in \textit{Ring1} mutants is due to the suppression of Hox-dependent specification programs by derepressed \textit{Hox13} paralogs (\textit{Hoxa13}, \textit{Hoxb13}, \textit{Hoxc13}, \textit{Hoxd13}). These results indicate that PRC1 can function in the absence of de novo PRC2-dependent histone methylation to maintain chromatin topology and postmitotic neuronal fate.},

	abstract = {Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2 are critical epigenetic developmental regulators. PRC1 and PRC2 largely overlap in their genomic binding and cooperate to establish repressive chromatin domains demarcated by H2AK119ub and H3K27me3. However, the functional contribution of each complex to gene repression has been a subject of debate, and understanding of its physiological significance requires further studies. Here, using the developing murine epidermis as a paradigm, we uncovered a previously unappreciated functional redundancy between Polycomb complexes. Coablation of PRC1 and PRC2 in embryonic epidermal progenitors resulted in severe defects in epidermal stratification, a phenotype not observed in the single PRC1-null or PRC2-null epidermis. Molecular dissection indicated a loss of epidermal identity that was coupled to a strong derepression of nonlineage transcription factors, otherwise repressed by either PRC1 or PRC2 in the absence of its counterpart. Ectopic expression of subsets of PRC1/2-repressed nonepidermal transcription factors in wild-type epidermal stem cells was sufficient to suppress epidermal identity genes, highlighting the importance of functional redundancy between PRC1 and PRC2. Altogether, our studies show how PRC1 and PRC2 function as two independent counterparts, thereby providing a repressive safety net that protects and preserves lineage identity.},

	abstract = {The Polycomb group (PcG) gene products form multimeric protein complexes and contribute to anterior-posterior (A-P) specification via the transcriptional regulation of Hox cluster genes. The Drosophila polyhomeotic genes and their mammalian orthologues, Phc1, Phc2, and Phc3, encode nuclear proteins that are constituents of evolutionarily conserved protein complexes designated class II PcG complexes. In this study, we describe the generation and phenotypes of Phc2-deficient mice. We show posterior transformations of the axial skeleton and premature senescence of mouse embryonic fibroblasts associated with derepression of Hox cluster genes and Cdkn2a genes, respectively. Synergistic actions of a Phc2 mutation with Phc1 and Rnf110 mutations during A-P specification, coimmunoprecipitation of their products from embryonic extracts, and chromatin immunoprecipitation by anti-Phc2 monoclonal antibodies suggest that Hox repression by Phc2 is mediated through the class II PcG complexes, probably via direct binding to the Hox locus. The genetic interactions further reveal the functional overlap between Phc2 and Phc1 and a strict dose-dependent requirement during A-P specification and embryonic survival. Functional redundancy between Phc2 and Phc1 leads us to hypothesize that the overall level of polyhomeotic orthologues in nuclei is a parameter that is critical in enabling the class II PcG complexes to exert their molecular functions.},

The Polycomb-group (PcG) repressive complex-1 (PRC1) forms microscopically visible clusters in nuclei; however, the impact of this cluster formation on transcriptional regulation and the underlying mechanisms that regulate this process remain obscure. Here, we report that the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain of a PRC1 core component Phc2 plays an essential role for PRC1 clustering through head-to-tail macromolecular polymerization, which is associated with stable target binding of PRC1/PRC2 and robust gene silencing activity. We propose a role for SAM domain polymerization in this repression by two distinct mechanisms: first, through capturing and/or retaining PRC1 at the PcG targets, and second, by strengthening the interactions between PRC1 and PRC2 to stabilize transcriptional repression. Our findings reveal a regulatory mechanism mediated by SAM domain polymerization for PcG-mediated repression of developmental loci that enables a robust yet reversible gene repression program during development.},

The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is an essential epigenetic regulator that deposits repressive H3K27me3. PRC2 subunits form two holocomplexes---PRC2.1 and PRC2.2---but the roles of these two PRC2 assemblies during differentiation are unclear. We employed auxin-inducible degradation to deplete PRC2.1 subunit MTF2 or PRC2.2 subunit JARID2 during differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to neural progenitors (NPCs). Depletion of either MTF2 or JARID2 resulted in incomplete differentiation due to defects in gene regulation. Distinct sets of Polycomb target genes were derepressed in the absence of MTF2 or JARID2. MTF2-sensitive genes were marked by H3K27me3 in ESCs and remained silent during differentiation, whereas JARID2-sensitive genes were preferentially active in ESCs and became newly repressed in NPCs. Thus, MTF2 and JARID2 contribute non-redundantly to Polycomb silencing, suggesting that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 have distinct functions in maintaining and establishing, respectively, Polycomb repression during differentiation.},

Here we describe optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture (ORCA), a method that can trace the DNA path in single cells with nanoscale accuracy and genomic resolution reaching two kilobases. We used ORCA to study a Hox gene cluster in cryosectioned Drosophila embryos and labelled around 30 RNA species in parallel. We identified cell-type-specific physical borders between active and Polycomb-repressed DNA, and unexpected Polycomb-independent borders. Deletion of Polycomb-independent borders led to ectopic enhancer--promoter contacts, aberrant gene expression, and developmental defects. Together, these results illustrate an approach for high-resolution, single-cell DNA domain analysis in vivo, identify domain structures that change with cell identity, and show that border elements contribute to the formation of physical domains in Drosophila.},

	abstract = {Summary
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) 1 and 2 are essential chromatin regulators of cell identity. PRC1, a dominant executer of Polycomb-mediated control, functions as multiple sub-complexes that possess catalytic-dependent H2AK119 mono-ubiquitination (H2AK119ub) and catalytic-independent activities. Here, we show that, despite its well-established repressor functions, PRC1 binds to both silent and active genes. Through in vivo loss-of-function studies, we show that global PRC1 function is essential for skin development and stem cell (SC) specification, whereas PRC1 catalytic activity is dispensable. Further dissection demonstrated that both canonical and non-canonical PRC1 complexes bind to repressed genes, marked by H2AK119ub and PRC2-mediated H3K27me3. Interestingly, loss of canonical PRC1, PRC1 catalytic activity, or PRC2 leads to expansion of mechanosensitive Merkel cells in neonatal skin. Non-canonical PRC1 complexes, however, also bind to and promote expression of genes critical for skin development and SC formation. Together, our findings highlight PRC1's diverse roles in executing a precise developmental program.},

Chromosome conformation capture technologies have revealed important insights into genome folding. Yet, how spatial genome architecture is related to gene expression and cell fate remains unclear. We comprehensively mapped 3D chromatin organization during mouse neural differentiation in vitro and in vivo, generating the highest-resolution Hi-C maps available to date. We found that transcription is correlated with chromatin insulation and long-range interactions, but dCas9-mediated activation is insufficient for creating TAD boundaries de novo. Additionally, we discovered long-range contacts between gene bodies of exon-rich, active genes in all cell types. During neural differentiation, contacts between active TADs become less pronounced while inactive TADs interact more strongly. An extensive Polycomb network in stem cells is disrupted, while dynamic interactions between neural transcription factors appear in vivo. Finally, cell type-specific enhancer-promoter contacts are established concomitant to gene expression. This work shows that multiple factors influence the dynamics of chromatin interactions in development.},

Chromatin interaction maps provide insights into the spatial organization of chromosomes and the mechanisms by which they fold. Hi-C and Micro-C are widely used 3C protocols that differ in key experimental parameters including cross-linking chemistry and chromatin fragmentation strategy. To understand how the choice of experimental protocol determines the ability to detect and quantify aspects of chromosome folding we have performed a systematic evaluation of 3C experimental parameters. We identified optimal protocol variants for either loop or compartment detection, optimizing fragment size and cross-linking chemistry. We used this knowledge to develop a greatly improved Hi-C protocol (Hi-C 3.0) that can detect both loops and compartments relatively effectively. In addition to providing benchmarked protocols, this work produced ultra-deep chromatin interaction maps using Micro-C, conventional Hi-C and Hi-C 3.0 for key cell lines used by the 4D Nucleome project.},

	abstract = {Polycomb-group proteins play critical roles in gene silencing through the deposition of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and chromatin compaction. This process is essential for embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency, differentiation, and development. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) can both read and write H3K27me3, enabling progressive spreading of H3K27me3 on the linear genome. Long-range Polycomb-associated DNA contacts have also been described, but their regulation and role in gene silencing remain unclear. Here, we apply H3K27me3 HiChIP, a protein-directed chromosome conformation method, and optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture to profile long-range Polycomb-associated DNA loops that span tens to hundreds of megabases across multiple topological associated domains in mouse ESCs and human induced pluripotent stem cells. We find that H3K27me3 loop anchors are enriched for Polycomb nucleation points and coincide with key developmental genes. Genetic deletion of H3K27me3 loop anchors results in disruption of spatial contact between distant loci and altered H3K27me3 in cis, both locally and megabases away on the same chromosome. In mouse embryos, loop anchor deletion leads to ectopic activation of the partner gene, suggesting that Polycomb-associated loops control gene silencing during development. Further, we find that alterations in PRC2 occupancy resulting from an RNA binding--deficient EZH2 mutant are accompanied by loss of Polycomb-associated DNA looping. Together, these results suggest PRC2 uses RNA binding to enhance long-range chromosome folding and H3K27me3 spreading. Developmental gene loci have unique roles in Polycomb spreading, emerging as important architectural elements of the epigenome.},

Distinct classes of CREs can be characterized by their epigenomic features, including DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, combinations of histone modifications and conformation of local chromatin. Tremendous progress has been made in cataloguing CREs in the human genome using bulk transcriptomic and epigenomic methods. However, single-cell epigenomic and multi-omic technologies have the potential to provide deeper insight into cell type-specific gene regulatory programmes as well as into how they change during development, in response to environmental cues and through disease pathogenesis. Here, we highlight recent advances in single-cell epigenomic methods and analytical tools and discuss their readiness for human tissue profiling.},

Here we systematically examined the state and accessibility of chromatin in the developing mouse fetus. In total we performed 1,128 chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP--seq) assays for histone modifications and 132 assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC--seq) assays for chromatin accessibility across 72 distinct tissue-stages. We used integrative analysis to develop a unified set of chromatin state annotations, infer the identities of dynamic enhancers and key transcriptional regulators, and characterize the relationship between chromatin state and accessibility during developmental gene regulation. We also leveraged these data to link enhancers to putative target genes and demonstrate tissue-specific enrichments of sequence variants associated with disease in humans. The mouse ENCODE data sets provide a compendium of resources for biomedical researchers and achieve, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive view of chromatin dynamics during mammalian fetal development to date.},

	abstract = {Precise control of gene expression is fundamental to cell function and development. Although ultimately gene expression relies on DNA-binding transcription factors to guide the activity of the transcription machinery to genes, it has also become clear that chromatin and histone post-translational modification have fundamental roles in gene regulation. Polycomb repressive complexes represent a paradigm of chromatin-based gene regulation in animals. The Polycomb repressive system comprises two central protein complexes, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2, which are essential for normal gene regulation and development. Our early understanding of Polycomb function relied on studies in simple model organisms, but more recently it has become apparent that this system has expanded and diverged in mammals. Detailed studies are now uncovering the molecular mechanisms that enable mammalian PRC1 and PRC2 to identify their target sites in the genome, communicate through feedback mechanisms to create Polycomb chromatin domains and control transcription to regulate gene expression. In this Review, we discuss and contextualize the emerging principles that define how this fascinating chromatin-based system regulates gene expression in mammals.},

This process of cell fate determination is controlled by precise temporal and spatial gene expression patterns that in turn are affected by epigenetic mechanisms including Polycomb group (PcG) regulation. PcG proteins assemble in multiprotein complexes and catalyze repressive posttranslational histone modifications. Their association with neurodevelopmental disease and various types of cancer of the central nervous system, as well as observations in mouse models, has implicated these epigenetic modifiers in controlling various stages of cortex development. The precise mechanisms conveying PcG-associated transcriptional repression remain incompletely understood and are an active field of research. PcG activity appears to be highly context-specific, raising the question of species-specific differences in the regulation of neural stem and progenitor regulation. In this review, we will discuss our growing understanding of how PcG regulation affects human cortex development, based on studies in murine model systems, but focusing mostly on findings obtained from examining impaired PcG activity in the context of human neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. Furthermore, we will highlight relevant experimental approaches for functional investigations of PcG regulation in human cortex development.},

	abstract = {Summary Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 1 maintains developmental genes in a poised state through monoubiquitination (Ub) of histone H2A. Although Ub-independent functions of PRC1 have also been suggested, it has remained unclear whether Ub-dependent and -independent functions of PRC1 operate differentially in a developmental context. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Ring1B, a core component of PRC1, is necessary for the temporary repression of key neuronal genes in neurogenic (early-stage) neural stem or progenitor cells (NPCs) but is dispensable for the persistent repression of these genes associated with the loss of neurogenic potential in astrogliogenic (late-stage) NPCs. Our results also suggest that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity of the NuRD/MBD3 complex and Phc2-dependent PRC1 clustering are necessary for the transition from the Ub-dependent to -independent function of PRC1. Together, these results indicate that Ub-independent mode of repression by PRC1 plays a key role in mammalian development during cell fate restriction.},

Through targeting numerous genes that affect cell cycle arrest, stemness deprivation, and lineage commitment, miR-17 \~{} 92 family controls the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells in both developmental and adult brains. Due to the essential roles of miR-17 \~{} 92 family, its misexpression is widely associated with acute and chronic neurological disorders by attenuating neurogenesis and facilitating neuronal apoptosis. The promising neurogenic potential of miR-17 \~{} 92 family also makes it a promising ``medicine''to activate the endogenous and exogenous regenerative machinery, thus enhance tissue repair and function recovery after brain injury.

	abstract = {It is well known that the chromosomes are organized in the nucleus and this spatial arrangement of genome play a crucial role in gene regulation and genome stability. Different techniques have been developed and applied to uncover the intrinsic mechanism of genome architecture, especially the chromosome conformation capture (3C) and 3C-derived methods. 3C and 3C-derived techniques provide us approaches to perform high-throughput chromatin architecture assays at the genome scale. However, the advantage and disadvantage of current methodologies of C-technologies have not been discussed extensively. In this review, we described and compared the methodologies of C-technologies used in genome organization studies with an emphasis on Hi-C method. We also discussed the crucial challenges facing current genome architecture studies based on 3C and 3C-derived technologies and the direction of future technologies to address currently outstanding questions in the field. These latest news contribute to our current understanding of genome structure, and provide a comprehensive reference for researchers to choose the appropriate method in future application. We consider that these constantly improving technologies will offer a finer and more accurate contact profiles of entire genome and ultimately reveal specific molecular machines govern its shape and function.},

Although Polycomb group proteins (PcG) are key factors for both temporary and persistent repression of the developmental genes, how the same group of proteins can differentially repress target genes remains unclarified. The identification of a variety of PcG complexes and activities sheds light on these issues. In this review, based on the recent findings including those with the use of interactome and Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C)-type analyses, we summarize the molecular mechanisms of PcG-mediated gene regulation and discuss how PcG regulates cell fate specification during neural development.},

	abstract = {Summary SETD1A encodes a histone methyltransferase whose de novo mutations are identified in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and confer a large increase in disease risk. Here, we generate Setd1a mutant mice carrying the frameshift mutation that closely mimics a loss-of-function variant of SCZ. Our Setd1a (+/−) mice display various behavioral abnormalities relevant to features of SCZ, impaired excitatory synaptic transmission in layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and altered expression of diverse genes related to neurodevelopmental disorders and synaptic functions in the mPFC. RNAi-mediated Setd1a knockdown (KD) specifically in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mPFC only recapitulates impaired sociality among multiple behavioral abnormalities of Setd1a (+/−) mice. Optogenetics-assisted selective stimulation of presynaptic neurons combined with Setd1a KD reveals that Setd1a at postsynaptic site is essential for excitatory synaptic transmission. Our findings suggest that reduced SETD1A may attenuate excitatory synaptic function and contribute to the pathophysiology of SCZ.},

@article{Omiya-2021,
	abstract = {The lateral ventricles of the adult mammalian brain are lined by a single layer of multiciliated ependymal cells, which generate a flow of cerebrospinal fluid through directional beating of their cilia as well as regulate neurogenesis through interaction with adult neural stem cells. Ependymal cells are derived from a subset of embryonic neural stem-progenitor cells (NPCs, also known as radial glial cells) that becomes postmitotic during the late embryonic stage of development. Members of the Geminin family of transcriptional regulators including GemC1 and Mcidas play key roles in the differentiation of ependymal cells, but it remains largely unclear what extracellular signals regulate these factors and ependymal differentiation during embryonic and early-postnatal development. We now show that the levels of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and Id1/4 protein expression---both of which are downstream events of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling---decline in cells of the ventricular-subventricular zone in the mouse lateral ganglionic eminence in association with ependymal differentiation. Exposure of postnatal NPC cultures to BMP ligands or to a BMP receptor inhibitor suppressed and promoted the emergence of multiciliated ependymal cells, respectively. Moreover, treatment of embryonic NPC cultures with BMP ligands reduced the expression level of the ependymal marker Foxj1 and suppressed the emergence of ependymal-like cells. Finally, BMP ligands reduced the expression levels of Gemc1 and Mcidas in postnatal NPC cultures, whereas the BMP receptor inhibitor increased them. Our results thus implicate BMP signaling in suppression of ependymal differentiation from NPCs through regulation of Gemc1 and Mcidas expression during embryonic and early-postnatal stages of mouse telencephalic development.},

	abstract = {Dorsal-ventral patterning of the mammalian telencephalon is fundamental to the formation of distinct functional regions including the neocortex and ganglionic eminence. While Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Wnt, and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling are known to determine regional identity along the dorsoventral axis, how the region-specific expression of these morphogens is established remains unclear. Here we show that the Polycomb group (PcG) protein Ring1 contributes to the ventralization of the mouse telencephalon. Deletion of Ring1b or both Ring1a and Ring1b in neuroepithelial cells induces ectopic expression of dorsal genes, including those for BMP and Wnt ligands, as well as attenuated expression of the gene for Shh, a key morphogen for ventralization, in the ventral telencephalon. We observe PcG protein--mediated trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine-27 and binding of Ring1B at BMP and Wnt ligand genes specifically in the ventral region. Furthermore, forced activation of BMP or Wnt signaling represses Shh expression. Our results thus indicate that PcG proteins suppress BMP and Wnt signaling in a region-specific manner and thereby allow proper Shh expression and development of the ventral telencephalon.},

@article{Yuizumi-2021,
	abstract = {Lysosomes have recently been implicated in regulation of quiescence in adult neural stem cells (NSCs). Whether lysosomes regulate the differentiation of neural stem-progenitor cells (NPCs) in the embryonic brain has remained unknown, however. We here show that lysosomes are more abundant in rapidly dividing NPCs than in differentiating neurons in the embryonic mouse neocortex and ganglionic eminence. The genes for TFEB and TFE3, master regulators of lysosomal biosynthesis, as well as other lysosome-related genes were also expressed at higher levels in NPCs than in differentiating neurons. Anatomic analysis revealed accumulation of lysosomes at the apical and basal endfeet of NPCs. Knockdown of TFEB and TFE3, or that of the lysosomal transporter Slc15a4, resulted in premature differentiation of neocortical NPCs. Conversely, forced expression of an active form of TFEB (TFEB-AA) suppressed neuronal differentiation of NPCs in association with upregulation of NPC-related genes. These results together point to a previously unappreciated role for TFEB and TFE3, and possibly for lysosomes, in maintenance of the undifferentiated state of embryonic NPCs. We further found that lysosomes are even more abundant in an NPC subpopulation that rarely divides and includes the embryonic origin of adult NSCs than in the majority of NPCs that divide frequently for construction of the embryonic brain, and that overexpression of TFEB-AA also suppressed the cell cycle of neocortical NPCs. Our results thus also implicate lysosomes in establishment of the slowly dividing, embryonic origin of adult NSCs.},

Therefore, precise regionalization is essential in the early stages of brain development, and irregular regionalization has been proposed as the cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. The mechanisms underlying brain regionalization have been well studied in terms of morphogen-induced expression of critical transcription factors for regionalization. NPC potential in different brain regions is defined by chromatin structures that regulate the plasticity of gene expression. Herein, we present recent findings on the importance of chromatin structure in brain regionalization, particularly with respect to its regulation by Polycomb-group proteins and chromatin accessibility.},

Adult NSCs in the subventricular zone are derived from a subpopulation of embryonic neural stem-progenitor cells (NPCs) that is characterized by a slower cell cycle relative to the more abundant rapid cycling NPCs that build the brain. Yet, how slow cell cycle can cause the establishment of adult NSCs remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Notch and an effector Hey1 form a module that is upregulated by cell cycle arrest in slowly dividing NPCs. In contrast to the oscillatory expression of the Notch effectors Hes1 and Hes5 in fast cycling progenitors, Hey1 displays a non-oscillatory stationary expression pattern and contributes to the long-term maintenance of NSCs. These findings reveal a novel division of labor in Notch effectors where cell cycle rate biases effector selection and cell fate.},
