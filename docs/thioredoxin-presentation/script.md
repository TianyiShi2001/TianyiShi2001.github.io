In this very brief presentation, I will give concise ansewers to this question that should hopefully satisfy both a taxpayer or a scientist. 

As you can see in the outline, I'll highlight implication of developmental biology in preventative medicine and healthcare, stem cell research, modern medicine in general, and oncology. 

# Prenatal Care

Tetatogen and congenital anomaly

- exogenous agens that cause birth defects are teratogens, they can be chemicals, radiations, or viral infections, and so on
- thalidomide
  - used to treat anxiety
  - malformed arms and legs
  - thee first major evidence that drugs could induce congenital anomalies
  - led to the development of greater drug regulation and monitoring in many countries
- alcohol interferes with fetal neural development and is shown to cause mental retardation in the newborn
  - abnormal facial development
  - most prevalent type of congenital mental retardation syndrome in the US
- in pregnant women, Zika virus directly infects the neural progenitor cells of the fetal cortex (vertically transmitted infection), resulting in the death of these cells
- Model organisms such as Xenopus and Denio, are often used to screen compound that have a high probability of being hazardous, because the early development of these organisms rely on the same basic paracrine factors and TFs as humans do. 
  - studies on model organisms have revealed three probable pathways for alcohol teratogenesis. first, generation of superoxide redicals; second, downregulation of Sonic hedgehog; third, intereference of the cell adhesion molecule L1

Nutrients

- Folic acid 
  - significantly reduces the chance of neural tube defects
  - it's recommended, by NHS, that all women should take a daily supplement of 400 migrograms of folic acid before they're pregnant and during the first 12 weeeks of pregnancy, when the baby's spine is developing
  - because it is impossible to obtain enough folic acid just from fodd

# Stem Cell

ES Cells

- ICM (embryoblast) and trophoblast
- derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts from IVF clinic
- harvesting human ES cells means destroying human embryos (5 days after fertilisation)
- raised ethical controversy

- the methods for directed differentiiation of these cells depends on the understanding of the normal sequence of embryonic inductions which has been built up by developmental biologists

iPS cells

- Reverting to undifferentated state
  - equivalent to embryonic stem cells 
  - capable of differentiating into almost all cell types
- Shinya Yamanaka factors: Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, c-Myc
- Regenerative Medicine
  - SMA clinical trial in Japan
- Organoids
  - An organoid is a miniaturized and simplified version of an organ produced in vitro in three dimensions that shows realistic micro-anatomy

# Cancer as a Disease of Development

- carcinogenesis can be viewed as a disease of development because it involes aberrations of the processes that underlie cell division, differentiation and morphogenesis
- once it was thought that carcinogenesis and metastasis were caused by cells that had acquired mutations enabling them to proliferate independent of the enviornment.
- but it turns out that this is not the complete explanation
- cancer cells can actuallt modify their environment, turning it into a cancer-promoting niche
- this means the progression of many cancers depends on reciprocal interactions between hte cancer cells and the supporting cells of their tissue environment
- Indeed, carcinogenesis appears to recapitulate steps of normal development, including the formation of a niche in which to proliferate, using the same or closely related signalling pathways


- Defects in cell-cell conmmunication
  - studies have shown that tumours can be cuased by altering hte structure of the surrounding tissue, and that these tumors can be suppressed by restoring an appropriate tissue envionment
  - althogh 80% human tumors are from epithelial cells, the cells that carcinogens act on are often not the epithelial cells themselves, but the mesenchymal stromal cells that surround and sustain the epithelia
  - there was a study in which normal and carcinogen-treated epithelia and mesenchyme in rat mammary glands are **recombined**, and it turns out that, tumor growth occurred not in carcinogen-treated epithelia, but in epithelia placed in combination with carcinogen-treated mesenchyme
  - in this case, the mesenchyme fails to give instructions to the epithelia to form normals structures, and epithelial cells exhibited a loose control of cell proliferation
- Defects in paracrine pathways
  - this brings us to the next notion: that tumors can occur by disruptions of paracrine signalling betweeen cells. 
  - Several key signaling pathways involved in embryogenesis, such as Hedgehog, Notch and Wnt, also have crucial roles in carcinogenesis when improperly activated in adults through sporadic mutatiions or other mechanisms
  - **the same chemicals that can cause teratogenesis by blocking a pathway in embryonic development may be useful in blocking the activation of cancer stem cells** Cyclopamine and other antagonists of the Shh pathway, e.g., appear to be useful in preventing hte generation and proliferation of meedulloblastoma stem cells
- Cancer stem cells
  - an aspect of viewing cancers as diseases of development is that the properties of tumors may emerge because of a population of cells that are analogous to adult stem cells
