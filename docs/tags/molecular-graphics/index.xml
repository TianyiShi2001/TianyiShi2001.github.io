      <description>Protein Structure Homology Modelling Swiss Model Model Evaluation GMQE (global model quality estimation) 0-1, higher better combines properties from the target-alignment and the template search method replecting the expected accuracy of a model built with that alignment and the template and the coverage of the target computed before modelling and after modelling. The latter also takes into account the QMEAN QMEAN QMEAN z score: around 0: ideal; &amp;lt; -4.0: low quality QMEAN is a composite estimator based on different geometrical properties and provides both global and local absolute quality estimates on the basis of one single model the QMEAN z-score provides an estimate of the ‘degree of nativeness’ of the structural features observed in the model on a global scale.</description>
