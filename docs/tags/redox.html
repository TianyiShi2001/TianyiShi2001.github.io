<!--
Thioredoxins are kept in the reduced state by the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase in a NADPH-dependent reaction. 

Plants have an unusually complex complement of Trxs composed of six well-defined types (Trxs f, m, x, y, h, and o) that reside in different cell compartments and function in an array of processes. In 2010 it was discovered for the first time that thioredoxin proteins are able to move from cell to cell, representing a novel form of cellular communication in plants.

Thioredoxins are small ubiquitous proteins with two redox-active cysteine rediuses separated by a pair of amino acids (CXXC)

TRXs *m, f, x, y, z* isoforms are located in the chloroplast, whereas TRXs *o* are mitochondrial and TRX *h* proteins are found in different subcellular compartments.

TRX *h* is the largest TRX gene family in plants, comprising nine different isoforms in Arabidopsis. First isolated from spinach leaves; outisde of the chloroplast. Lack of a transit peptide; initially assumed as solely cytosolic proteins. However, alternative locations were also observed for some of them: plasma membrane, endomembranes (ER & Golgi), mitochondria, and the nucleus. Highly redundant -> difficult to unequivocally determine the function of each TRX *h* isoform

Besides the plastid and mitochondria, Trxs are also found in the cytosol, ER and nucleus of plant cells. Little is known about the function of nucleoredoxins (Nrx) and ER-Trxs, the function of cytosolic Trx *h* has been well documented.

Trx regulates photosynthesis and the TCA cycle in chloroplasts and mitochondria, respectively.

Extraplastidial Trxs hhave been shown to be important in the regulation of different processes such as seed germination, seedling establishment, C, N, and mitochondrial metabolism as well as for plant stress tolerance.

# Trx reduction systems

In extraplastidial compartments the reducing power for Trx reduction is provided by NADPH via NADPH-Trx reductase A (NTRA) and NTRB.

The cytosolic h-type thioredoxins act as key regulators of seed germination and are recycled by NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase

## In seed

Seeds develop in a metabolically active state but become quiescent during maturatiion and drying. This period is characterised by low water content and low metabolic activity as well as the non-enzymatic accumulation of reactive oxygen species (roS) that oxidise proteins and RNA. Oxidation of the thiol groups of cysteine -> changes in protein structure -> lowering solubility and modifying enzyme function -> protection against denaturation and proteolysis as the seed matures and dries.

Under favourable conditions, the seed germinates and thhe seedling draws on stored reserves for growth and development. Large increase in ROS produced as side-products of metabolism. ROS have important signalling roles in germination (but also cause oxidative stress if present in high amounts). The Trx system represents an important waay to regulate ROS in seeds.

## NTR

The NTRA and NTRB are found in both cytosol and mitochondrion, while thhe first has also been found in the nucleuus. NTRA and NTRB are mainly expressed in the cytosol and mitochondrion, respectively.

The NADPH used by the NTR/Trx system is generated by the OPPP through the activity of G6PDH and 6-PGDH, while the souruce of NADPH in the mitoochondion is throuugh the activity of IDH or NADHk. 


# Methods

## Alkylation Labelling


@Kobrehel-1992 applied the fluorescnet alkylating reagent monobromobimane (mBBr) to label free thiol groups in proteins following reduction by Thx. -> discovered that gliadins and glutenin are reduced in vivo during germination

Buchanan and co-workers pioneered the use of proteomics for Trx target identiﬁcation and applied the ﬂuorescent alkylating reagent monobromobimane (mBBr) to label free sulfhydryl (SH) groups in proteins following reduction by Trx [37]. This approach can be applied not only to in vitro but to in vivo reactions as well [2,40,45,46]. To identify targets from peanut seeds, mBBr-labelled proteins were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and ﬂuorescent spots were subjected to trypsin digestion followed by either Edman sequencing or mass spectrometry for protein identiﬁcation

Lane 1, Control: no addition [1.1]; lane 2, GSH/GR/NADPH: GSH, glutathione re- ductase(fromspinachleaves),andNADPH [1.2];lane3,NGS: NADPH, GSH, glutathione reductase (from spinach leaves), and glutaredoxin (from E. coli) [1.6]; lane 4, NTS: NADPH, NTR, and thioredoxin (both proteins from E. coli) [3.9]; lane 5, MET/T(Ec): ,B- mercaptoethanolandthioredoxin(E.co/i)[1.8];lane6,DTT [2.5]; lane7,DTT/T(Ec):DTT andthioredoxin(E.co/i)[3.0];lane8,DTT/ T(W): same as lane 7 except with wheat thioredoxin h [3.6]; lane 9, NGS,-Gliadin: same as lane 3 except without the gliadin protein fraction [0]; lane 10, NTS,-Gliadin: same as lane 4 except without thegliadinproteinfraction[0].

The above findings demonstrate that thioredoxin specifically reduces components of the wheat gliadin and glutenin fractions when tested in vitro. The results, however, provide no indication as to whether these proteins are reduced in vivo during germination-a question that, to our knowledge, has not been previously addressed (cf. 27).

To answer this question, we applied the mBBr/SDS-PAGE technique to monitor the reduction status of proteins in the germinating seed. We observed that reduction of components in the Osborne fractions increased progressively with time and reached a peak after 2 to 3 d germination (Fig. 4). The observed increase in reduction ranged from twofold with the gliadins to threefold with the albumin/globulins and fivefold with the glutenins. The net redox change was most apparent in the gliadins and glutenins found to undergo maximal reduction by thioredoxin, i.e. the 30- to 50-kD gliadins and 30- to 60-kD glutenins (cf. Figs. 1 and 3). The redox changes taking place in these fractions during germination are shown in Figure 5.

## CXXS

@Verdoucq-1999

In the thiol-disulfide exchange reaction, Trx forms a transient intermolecular disufide bond with the target protein involving the more N-terminal cysteine in the active site of Trx (CXXC). Then, the other cysteine (CXXC) attacks the disulﬁde bond of the Trx-target intermediate and releases the reduced target and oxidized Trx.

If instead this second cysteine is replaced with a serine residue through site-directed mutagenesis the Trx loses its capability to reduce the intermolecular disulﬁde bond and the covalent Trx-target complex will be stabilized. This strategy was first applied by Verdoucq et al. [49] who constructed a monocysteinic Trx mutant of A. thaliana Trxh3. The protein was heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisae and it was successfully stabilized in a complex with a peroxiredoxin target protein.

The concept was further developed by Motohashi et al. [50] who immobilized a monocysteinic Trx m on a resin designed to trap targets on a column. Non-targets were removed with the column wash and the trapped targets could subsequently be eluted with a chemical reductant such as DTT (Fig. 3). This approach has been used to identify target proteins from plant mitochondria [51–53], chloroplasts [54], cytosolic extracts [55], and has also been combined with the thiol alkylation approach described above to identify putative target proteins, for example in seeds from M. truncatula [40].

Improved by @Motohashi-2001 (initially applied to Trx m) 
Sepharose 4B resin

@Yamazaki-2004 Target Proteins of the Cytosolic Thioredoxins in Arabidopsis thaliana.
The obtained proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 

The results in this study and recent proteomics studies on the target proteins of chloroplast thioredoxin indicate the versatility and the physiological significance of thioredoxin as reductant in plant cell.

## Differential Labelling of Recombinant BASI (IAA and 4-VP)

- for the well studied chloroplastic thiioredoxins, target disulphide bonds in target enzymes were mainly idenitified by using strategies based on site directed mutagenesis of target proteins
- hoowever, to produce recombinant target proteiins and their mutants would be entremely time-consumiing considering the large number of potential target proteins of thioredoxin h that have been identifieid
- Using mass spectrometry techniques, peptide fragments containing modifications are recognised in hte peptide mass maps according to an exact mass shift from the expected thhiioretical values.
- the thiol and disulphiide forms of cysteine side chains, however, are usually not distinguishhed in MS because complete reduction and alkylation of cysteines are performed during regular sample preparation
- A novel strategy is developed by @Maeda-2005.
- Trypsin digesting
- According to the mass difference of cysteines modified by these two reagents, conversion of disulphides to thiols catalysed by HvTrxh1 was shown in the peptide mass maps of recombinant BASI.

# Rice

Cereals store reserve proteins in the endosperm during maturation of grain. In germination and early seedling development, these proteins are digested to provide nitrogen for growth. In rice and certain other seeds, the major storage proteins are 11S globulins housed in the protein body of the endosperm. Generally, 11S globulins are hexamers composed of identical subunits, each containing two polypeptide chains (Hara et al. 1976, Müntz 1998). The acidic chain, with one presumed intramolecular disulfide bond, is connected to the basic chain by an intermolecular disulfide bond (Staswick et al. 1984, Lawrence et al. 1994) (Fig. 1). The basic chain also contains a free sulfhydryl group. In rice, the proteins corresponding to 11S globulins, the glutelins, are unique in that they exist as large macromolecular complexes formed by disulfide and hydrophobic interactions of acidic and basic polypeptides (Katsube et al. 1999).
