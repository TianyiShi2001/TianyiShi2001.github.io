      <description>(a) Assign each lac mutation to one of the strains 1 to 5. Explain your reasoning in each case.
1 2 3 4 5 WT glycerol + − + − − - glycerol+IPTG + − + + − + glucose+IPTG − − − + − - ×WT hybrid + glycerol IPTG IPTG + IPTG IPTG ×lacY− hybrid IPTG × Strain 1: lacI- Strain 2: lacZ- Strain 3: lacOc Strain 4: mutation that causes RNAP to bind more easily Strain 5: lacP- Strains 1 and 3 are both sensitive to catabolite repression (by glucose) but insensitive to induction by IPTG (transcription occurs as long as glucose is not present), which can be either due to lacI- or lacOc.</description>
