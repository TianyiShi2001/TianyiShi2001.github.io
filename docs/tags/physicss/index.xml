      <description>Guinea pig A guinea pig was given a single injection of 24NaCl (0.5ml of 0.5\(\mu\)Ci/ml). Subsequently, 0.2 ml samples of blood were taken at intervals and counted for radioactivity. The following results were obtained. The efficiency of counting 24Na is 30%.
(a) Given that the radioactive half-life of 24Na is 15h, calculate the biological half life of Na+ in the guinea pig body. Why are these values different?
Radioactive decay is a first-order process, so the rate of decay is proportional to the amount of the decaying substance.</description>
