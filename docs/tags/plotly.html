<p>Circular dichorism measures the difference in absorption of left-hand and right-hand circularly polarised light by optically active (chiral) molecules (usually biological macromolecules). It serves as a rapid way to assess structural information on proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, pharmaceuticals, liquiud crystals, etc., in the solution state.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Physical Principles</h2>
<p>Electromagnetic waves (EM waves) has an electrical (E) component and a magnetic (M) component perpendicular to each other and both are perpendicular to the axis of propagation. Usually, only the E component is depicted for simplicity.</p>
<p>Most light sources have E components in all orientations, and when they pass through a slit, they become plane polarised, and can be represented by a simple sinusoidal wave. Adding up two plane polarised light perpendicular to each other produces interesting resultant waves, which can be visualised with <strong>plotly</strong> in R <span class="citation">(Sievert 2018)</span> (which is an uncommon use ‘invented’ by me<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>). Assuming we are superposing two sinusoidal waves of the same amplitude and frequency with various phase differences, we can then compute the pattern of the resultant wave as a function of the phase difference:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(plotly)
library(tibble)

calc_waves &lt;- function(phase_diff = 0){
  # compute y and z values for given x values of the waves 
  # first arbitrarily choose evenly-spaced points on the x_axis
  x_axis = x=seq(1,20,0.1) 
  # compute the y, z values of the first sin wave on the xy plane
  sin1 &lt;- tibble(x=x_axis,y=sin(x),z=0)
  # compute the y, z values of the second sin wave on the xz plane, 
  # taking the phase difference into account
  sin2 &lt;- tibble(x=x_axis,y=0,z=sin(x + phase_diff))
  # compute the axes of the resultant wave
  # each y and z value is the sum of corresponding values in the 2 component waves
  resultant &lt;- tibble(x=x_axis, y = sin1$y+sin2$y, z = sin1$z+sin2$z)
  
  return(list(sin1, sin2, resultant))
} 

plot_waves &lt;- function(wave_list, components = c(&#39;sin1&#39;, &#39;sin2&#39;), resultant = &#39;resultant&#39;){
  # plotting
  plot_ly() %&gt;% 
    add_trace(x=~x, y=~y, z=~z, name=components[1], data = wave_list[[1]], type=&#39;scatter3d&#39;, mode=&#39;lines&#39;) %&gt;% 
    add_trace(x=~x, y=~y, z=~z, name=components[2], data = wave_list[[2]], type=&#39;scatter3d&#39;, mode=&#39;lines&#39;) %&gt;% 
    add_trace(x=~x, y=~y, z=~z, name=resultant, data = wave_list[[3]], type=&#39;scatter3d&#39;, mode=&#39;lines&#39;)
}</code></pre>
<p>When phase difference is zero, the resultant wave is also sinusoidal, and the plane in which it resides is oriented at 45<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span> to each component wave, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:si">1.1</a> (<em>this is an interactive HTML widget so you can rotate, drag and zoom!

<p>As shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:plane-polarised">1.4</a> If we add up the left and right circularly polarised light, the resultant is a plane polarised light. Thus it can be said that a plane polarised light can be viewed as being made up of two circularly polarised components of equal magnitude and frequency.</p>

Figure 1.4: Addition of two identical waves of oppsite handedness results in a plane polarised wave.
</p>
</div>
<p>CD measures differential absorption of these components. If the two components are absorbed to the same extent, clearly the resultant will still be planar as shown above. If there is differential absorption, as I simulate in Fig. <a href="#fig:diff-absorb">1.5</a>, the resultant wave will be elliptical polarised. Here the R component is absorbed more than the L component, and the resultant ellipsed wave is left-handed. The CD signal (formally <span class="math inline">\(\Delta A=\Delta A_\text{L}-\Delta A_\text{R}\)</span>) is generally reported in terms of the ellipticity, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, of this resultant wave. <span class="math inline">\(\theta=\arctan(b/a)\)</span> where b and a are the minor and major axes of the ellipse. <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> can be easily converted to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta A\)</span> by the simple relationship: <span class="math inline">\(\theta=32.98\Delta A\)</span>. The CD spectrum is obtained when the CD signal <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\Delta A\)</span> is measured as a function of wavelength.</p>

<p>A CD signal will be observed when a chromophore is chiral (either intrinsically chiral, bonded to a chiral atom, or due to asymmetric enviornment).

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Experimental Setup</h2>
<p>The EM wave used in CD is UV, usually with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> in the range 170~320 nm. Traditionally Xe arc lamps have been used as the light source of UV, but they can hardly achieve a wavelength below 180 nm. Now, high frequency UV can be generated by modern synchrotrons, and extending of CD data into the far UV region improves reliability of secondary structure prediction (see Section <a href="#ss">1.3</a>).</p>
<p>There are various methods by which the CD effect can be measured in a spectropolarimeter:</p>
<ul>
<li>modulation, in which the incident readiation is continuously switched between the L and R ocmponents</li>
<li>direct subtraction, in whiich the absorbances of the 2 components are measured separately and subtracted from each other</li>
<li>ellipsometric, in which the ellipticity of the transmitted radiation is measured</li>
</ul>
<p>The modulation method is most commonly used. The experimental setup is described as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>plane polarised light is split into the L and R components by passage through a modulator subjected to an alternating electric field</li>
<li>the modulator normally consists of a piezoelectric quartz crystal and a thin plate of isotropic material (e.g. fused silica) tightly coupled to the crystal.</li>
<li>the alternating electric field induces structural changes in the quartz crystal; these make the plate transmit circularly polarised light at the extremes of the field</li>
<li>as the transmitted radiation of switched between L and R components, these are detecred in turn by the photomultiplier.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Application of CD</h2>
<p>Far UV and near UV regions of CD give different information about a protein.</p>
<p>Absorption in the far UV region (170-250 nm) is mainly due to the <span class="math inline">\(\pi\rightarrow\pi^*\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\rightarrow\pi^*\)</span> transitions in the peptide bonds, which is dependent on <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> torsional angles. Thus different types of secondary structures, such as <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-helices, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-sheets, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-turns, each have their characteristic CD spectrum (Fig. <a href="#fig:cd">1.6</a>). These standard curves can be linearly combined to estimate the proportion of each secondary structure in a protein of interest.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The spectra in the near-UV region (260-320 nm) arise from the aromatic amino acids, each with a characteristic CD profile. The actual shape of the near UV CD spectrum will depend on the number of each type of aromic amino acid present, their mobility, their residing environment. Thus it can serve as a fingerprint of the of the tertiary structure of a protein.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>By combining the far- and near-UV CD spectra, we can obtain a summary of the overall structural features of the protein of interest. Although it gives little insight into the precise 3D structure of the protein, it serves at a rapid way to detect conformational differences between two similar proteins <em>in solution</em>. Specifically, it can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>monitor the progress of protein folding (especially the detectiion of molten globule-like structures)</li>
<li>compare the wild type and mutant forms of a protein</li>
<li>confirm a modification (tagging) will not affect the protein’s native conformation and normal function</li>
<li>assess thermal stability (unfolding at high temperature)</li>
<li>show the formation of amyloid <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> protein in Alzheimer disease <span class="citation">(Barrow et al. 1992)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>CD can not only be applied to proteins but also to other chiral molecules. Such applications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>determination of nucleic acid conformations (A-RNA, A-DNA, B-DNA, Z-DNA)</li>
<li>determination of nucleic acid-ligand interactions, e.g. between cationic porphyrins and DNA <span class="citation">(Pasternack 2003)</span></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Experimentation and Data Processing</h2>
<p>SAXS uses a collimated monochromatic X-ray beam to illuminate the sample, and the intensity of the scattered X-rays a is recorded. The scattering of the pure solvent is also collected and subtracted from the sample solution scattering. The resulting 2D scattering pattern is translated into a 1D <em>I</em> vs. <em>q</em> relationship (where <em>I</em> is intensity and <span class="math inline">\(q = 4\pi\sin(\theta/2)/\lambda\)</span>), and the data is transformed and plotted in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>Several parameters can be calculated from SAXS data, including molecular weight, excluded particle volume, maximum dimension <span class="math inline">\(D_\text{max}\)</span> and the radius of gyration <span class="math inline">\(R_g\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_g\)</span> can be directly extracted from SAXS data using the Guinier approximation, which states that, when the incident angle is small (approaching 0), the angular dependence of scattering can be described by the equation <span class="math inline">\(I(q)=I_z\exp(-q^2R_g^2/3)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(R_g\)</span> is the radius of gyration of the particle. When <span class="math inline">\(\ln(I(q))\)</span> is plotted against <span class="math inline">\(q^2\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\ln(I(q)) = \ln{I_0}-(R_g^2/3)q^2\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(R_g^2/3\)</span> is the slope of the resulting straight line.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_g\)</span> provides a measure of the overall size of the macromolecule. It is the average root-mean-square distance to the centre of density in the molecule weighted by the scattering length density.</p>

<p>The analytical centrifuge (AUC) is a high speed (up to 60000 rpm) ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance and interference detection systems, which allow the analysis of the redistribution of macromolecular solute under the influence of a centrifugal field. AUC is a convenient, matrix-free solution technique without requirement for immobilisation, columns, or membranes.</p>
<p>Typical AUC experiments can be classified into two types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>sedimentation velocity experiment:</strong> record the <em>change in concentration distribution</em> over time (performed at high speed)</li>
<li><strong>sedimentation equilibrium experiment:</strong> record the <em>steady state distribution</em> of the macromolecular solute following equiilibration of centrifugal and diffusive forces (performed at lower speed)</li>
</ul>
<p>These two methods can give information about a wide range of parameters of protein-protein interactions, including stoichiometry, reversibility, strength and, in some cases, dynamics.</p>
<p>Apart from protein-protein interactions, AUC is now applied to study interactions of a wider range of macromolecules, such as protein-like carbohydrate assocaition, carbohydrate-protein association (polysaccharide-gliadin), and nucleic acid protein (G-duplexes) interactions.</p>

<div id="sedimentation-velocity-sv" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Sedimentation Velocity (SV)</h3>
<p>In the SV experiment, measurements on the absorption (<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, which is proportional to local concentration) at different radial distances (<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>) from the rotation centre are made at fixed time intervals (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>), producing a series of s-shaped curves that shift to higher <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> values as sedimentation proceeds (Fig. <a href="#fig:auc-sv-data">3.1</a>.</p>
<p>The spinning rotor generates a sedimentation force on a particle of <span class="math inline">\(m\omega^2r\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> = particle mass; <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> = angular velocity; <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> = distance from the centre of rotation). In solution, the particle displaces solvent, so the sedimentation force acts on an effective mass, <span class="math inline">\(m_\text{eff}=m(1-\bar v\rho)\)</span> that is less than <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> = solvent density; <span class="math inline">\(\bar v\)</span> = partial-specific volume (in ml/g)). <span class="math inline">\(\bar v\)</span> is usually calculated (for proteins, <span class="math inline">\(\bar v\)</span> lies in the range 0.70-0.75, leading to <span class="math inline">\((1-\bar v\rho)\)</span> of around 0.27 (in water)). At terminal velocity (acceleration = 0), the sedimentation force is balanced by the frictional force and the velocity can be described by the equation <span class="math inline">\(v=m(1-\bar{v}\rho)\omega^2r/f\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the friction coefficient, which is related to the diffusion coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, by <span class="math inline">\(f=RT/N_\text{A}D\)</span>. The equation can thus be arranged to <span class="math inline">\(v=DM(1-\bar{v}\rho)\omega^2r/RT\)</span>. By defining the <em>sedimentation coefficient</em> as <span class="math inline">\(s=v/\omega^2r\)</span>, the <em>Svedberg equation</em> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(s=\dfrac{DM(1-\bar{v}\rho)}{RT}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The sedimentation coefficient <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, which is experimentally determined in SV has the unit Svedberg (S) where 1 S = 10<sup>-13</sup> seconds. The greater the molecular weight or more compact/spherical (less friction) the macromolecule is, the larger its <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> value. Usually the experimentally measured <span class="math inline">\(s_\text{exp}\)</span> is standarised to <span class="math inline">\(s_{20, \text{w}}\)</span>, which is the value that would have been observed in water at 20<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C, using the relationship <span class="math inline">\(s_{20, \text{w}}=\dfrac{s_\text{exp}(\eta_\text{exp}(1-\bar{v}\rho_\text{20,w})}{(\eta_\text{20,w}(1-\bar{v}\rho_\text{exp})}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> refer to the viscosity and density of the buffer.</p>
<p>The Lamm equation, derived from Svedberg equation and Fick’s diffusion laws, describes the time dependence of the concentration:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=D\left[\left(\frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial r^2}\right)+\frac{1}{r}\left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial r}\right)\right]-s\omega^2\left[r\left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial r}\right)+2c\right]\]</span></p>
<p>Solving this diffential equation leads to <span class="math inline">\(g(s)\)</span>, which is the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. SEDFIT is one of the softwares specialised in solving this. SEDFIT can either give the uncorrected <span class="math inline">\(g(s)\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> profile, or it can give a distribution, known as <span class="math inline">\(c(s)\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, which has been corrected for diffusion broadening (this assumes all particles have the same frictional ratio <span class="math inline">\(f/f_o\)</span>). The <span class="math inline">\(g(s)\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(c(s)\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> can further be converted to a molecular weight distribution, <span class="math inline">\(c(M)\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, which is analogous to a mass spectrum (Fig. <a href="#fig:auc-sv-data">3.1</a>). SEDFIT is particularly good at evaluating homogeneity/heterogeneity of a prepation. Where the solution is heterogeneous, it can estimate the proportion of each sedimenting species and ascertain whether there is a reversible equilibrium.</p>

<p>SV also gives information about the shape. The friction coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, can be easily calculated from the terminal velocity (<span class="math inline">\(v=m(1-\bar{v}\rho)\omega^2r/f\)</span>), and the friction ratio, <span class="math inline">\(f/f_o\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(f_o=6\pi r\eta\)</span>), shows diviation of the molecular shape from the sphere.</p>
<p>SV can also be applied for interaction analysis, and the simpest case is co-sedimentation. For example, the binding of adenosylcobalamin cofactor to the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase system from <em>Propionibacterium shermanii</em> was demonstrated by AUC with UV-absoption system. At a wavelength selected to detect the ligand only, in the presence of the mutase, all ligands sediment at the same rate as the protein, confirming the ligand is 100% bound.</p>
<p>In SV analysis, the emergence of new peaks at higher concentrations, shifts in the ratios of the peak areas, and/or shifts in peak positions are indicative of protein-protein interactions.</p>
<p>Fig. <a href="#fig:sv-trap">3.2</a> shows an SV experiment which studies the binding between the <em>Bacillus stearothermophilus</em> 11-mer protein TRAP (<em>trp</em> RNA-binding attentuation protein) and Anti-TRAP (AT). As the TRAP:AT ratio increases froom 1:0 to 1:6, the peak representing TRAP shifts to higher <em>s</em>, indicating rapid and reversible binding between TRAP and AT (slow/irreversible interaction would result in separate peaks). The plot also shows that TRAP was saturated with AT at a 1:6 stoichiometry (as increasing ratio to 1:10 did not result in further shifts) and that the TRAP-AT complex was stable to excess AT (no negative feedback loop).</p>
