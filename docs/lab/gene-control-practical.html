<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Identify the WT Strain</h1>
<p><em>You are provided with two strains of coli labelled A and B, one of which (‘wild type’) is subject to catabolite repression, and one of which is not. Devise an experimental protocol to determine which strain is the wild type strain.</em></p>
<p>The E.coli strains are already grown on minimal medium containing 1% glycerol as a ‘poor’ carbon source (which should result in a <em>high</em> intracellualr cAMP concentration). Thus, to test for sensitivity of catabolite repression, we add a ‘good’ carbon source — glucose (which should increase cAMP level and repress galactosidase synthesis).</p>
<div id="protocol" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Protocol</h2>
<ul>
<li>Measure OD<sub>600</sub> of both strains.</li>
<li>For each of strains A and B, set up two flasks, <code>+glucose</code> and <code>-glucose</code> (i.e. 4 flasks in total); then:
<ul>
<li>Add 9.440 ml of <em>E. coli</em> to all flasks</li>
<li>collect 2 samples, at -2 min and 0 min which represent baseline activity and then:</li>
<li>add 0.5 ml of glucose solution or glycerol solution to <code>+glucose</code> flasks and <code>-glucose</code> flasks, respectively</li>
<li>collect 3 samples at 2, 4, 6 min and then:</li>
<li>Add 0.1 ml IPTG (100 mM) to all flasks and mix (start induction)</li>
<li>From 8 to 18 min, take 6 samples at 2 min intervals</li>
<li>Add 0.1 ml cAMP to all flasks</li>
<li>Collect samples and set up a blank: 20 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l of salt solution plus 80 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l permeabilisation reagent. (the blank is used by all samples taken from 4 flasks)</li>
<li>Add 75 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l of ONPG to 75 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l of each sample and the blank. Incubate at 37<sup>o</sup>C.</li>
<li>Incubate for appropriate amount of time (as determined in part 1)</li>
<li>Read absorption at 415 nm against the blank.</li>
<li>Plot a graph of A<sub>415</sub> against time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compare the plots. The strain unresponsive to catabolite inhibition should give similar plots in both <code>+glucose</code> and <code>-glucose</code> conditions. The WT strain should show lower A<sub>415</sub> (galactosidase activity) when glucose is added, since its galactosidase synthesis is inhibited by the ‘good’ carbon source, pyruvate.</li>

<!-- cAMP production is promoted by a lack of metabolites (or unavailability of 'good' carbon sources), and cAMP in turn allows for galactosidase production via CAP. Here, -->
<p>Since our bacteria are grown on minimal medium containing 1% glycerol as a ‘poor’ carbon source (which should result in a <em>high</em> intracellualr cAMP concentration), we need to first use glucose to inhibit galactosidase production (as described in part 2). Then, we add cAMP. If the added cAMP enhances the production of galactosidase, we can prove that it’s cAMP whose level is decreased during catabolite repression (by addition of a ‘good’ carbon source, pyruvate).</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong> Strain B is WT. In strain B, galactosidase activity was significantly lower in <code>+glucose</code> than in <code>-glucose</code> from <code>t = 6 min</code> to <code>t = 18 min</code> (after IPTG induction, before addition of cAMP). In strain A the difference is less pronounced. Addition of cAMP at <code>t = 18 min</code> markedly increased galactosidase activity in <code>strain B + glucose</code> setup, but had no noticeable effects in the other three setups. This means catabolite repression by glucose is mediated by lowering concentration of cAMP, and thus an addition of cAMP could relieve this repression.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Protocol</h2>
<p>Repeat the experimental procedure described in part 2 with only the WT strain (strain B) and replacing glucose with different <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-keto acids. The concentration of the ketoacids are 0.5 M. Thus, to make their concentration in the 10 ml reaction mixture be 10 mM, 0.2 mL of each was added to different flasks individually (alpha-ketoglutarate was 1.0 M, so 0.1 mL of it was added instead).</p>
<!-- - Use the WT strain in this set of experiments.
- 4 experiments will be done for each $\alpha$-keto acid. Adding the control, there will be a total of 13 experiments. (if there isn't enough reagent, just scale everything by 1/10)
- Make 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions of each $\alpha$-keto acid.  (*do we need to be quantitative (i.e. comparing the effectiveness of different metabolite)? If this is just a qualitative assessment we don't need multiple dilutions to prove their involvement in catabolite repression and inhibition of cAMP synthesis (we only need 2 experiments for each ketoacid)*)

|            | $\alpha$-ketoglutarate | pyruvate | succinate |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 1:1        |                        |          |           |
| 1:10       |                        |          |           |
| 1:100      |                        |          |           |
| 1:1 + cAMP |                        |          |           |

For each cell of the above table:

- Take 9.0 ml of *E. coli* and add 0.9 ml of the dilution.
- Wait for 5 minutes to allow the bacteria adapt to the addition of  $\alpha$-keto acid.
- Add 0.1 ml IPTG (100 mM) and mix (start induction).
- At 1 min intervals take 20 $\mu$l sample and add to a microtube containing 80 $\mu$l permeabilisation reagent
- Collect samples and set up a blank: 20 $\mu$l of uninduced *E. coli* plus 80 $\mu$l permeabilisation reagent. (the blank is only made once and used for all measurements)
- Add 75 $\mu$l of ONPG to 75 $\mu$l of each sample and the blank. Incubate at 37^o^C.
- Incubate for appropriate amount of time (as determined in part 1)
- Read absorption at 415 nm against the blank.
- Plot a graph of A~415~ against time. -->
<p>If the addition of an <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-keto acid alone causes the activity of galactosidase to decrease, it can be considered as the evidence that this ketoacid is involved in catabolite repression. If the following addition of cAMP can ‘rescue’ galactosidase activity, then this can be considered as the evidence that this ketoacid inhibits cAMP synthesis.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong> All three <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-keto acids are shown to be capable of catabolite repression. After adding IPTG, the extents to which the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-galactosidase activity increases in <em>E. coli</em> provided with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-keto acids are significantly and consistently lower than in <em>E. coli</em> provided with glycerol only. Addition of cAMP has no significant effect on the <code>glycerol</code> control, but was able to improve the rate of increase of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-galactosidase activity (gradient on the graph) in groups with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-keto acids to about the same as the <code>glycerol</code> control (shown as tangent lines in the plot). The capability of different <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-keto acids can be ranked qualitatively: pyruvate &gt; <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-ketoglutarate &gt; succinate.</p>
