# What is the Point of Studying Developmental Biology?

Development accomplishes two major objectives

  - generates cellular diversity and order within individual organism
  - ensures the continuity of life from one generation to the next

The Questions of Developmental Biology 

- The question of differentiation: how can a single fertilised egg cell generate so many different cell types?
- The question of morphogenesis: how can the cells in our body organise into functional structures? Cell division, migration and death.
- the question of growth: how do our cells know when to stop dividing?
- the question of reproduction: how are the germ cells set apart , and what are the instructions in the nucleus and cytoplasm that allow them to form the next generation?
- the question of regeneration: how to stem cells retain the capacity of forming new structures even in adutls, and can we harness it to tcure debilitating diseases?
- the question of enviornmental integration: how is the development of an organism integrated into the larger context of its habitat? (the development of many (perhaps all) organisms is influenced by cues from the envionment that isurrounds the emmbryo or larva)
- the question of evolution: how do changes in devellopment create new body forms? Which heritable changes are possible, given the constraints imposed by the necessity of the organism to survive as it develops?

### Transforming Basic Developmental Biology Questions into Medical Ones



- What processes lead to fertilisation and the initiation of development? *How can we overcome infertility and childlessness?*
- How do single fertilised egg cells, or later on groups of progenitor cells, generate the enormous cellular diversity of an organism and its organs and tissues? *How do stem/progenitor cells generate whole tissues or organs – for example in regeneration or tissue engineering, and how does wound healing work?*
- How do cells, which originate from common ancestors and contain the same genetic information, adopt different fates? *How do cells change their identities and behaviours – for example in cancer?*
- How do tissues and their cells know when to stop growing? *How can cells evade growth control – for example in tumour growth?*
- How is the formation of different cells/tissues coordinated in space and time? *What are the patho-mechanisms underlying birth disorders?*

### Developmental Defects: Causes and Prevention

According to the US’ National Research Council, over half of initial pregnancies are affected by developmental defects, ~3% of live births suffer from major developmental aberrations, ~70% of neonatal deaths are due to developmental defects. 

The causes can be **random errors, inherited or acquired gene mutations or toxins** – as illustrated by severe limb malformations of thousands of new-borns during the **thalidomide**/Contergan drug scandal in the 1950s, or the stark increase in birth defects after the Bhopal gas catastrophe in 1984.

Not only to understand or even treat human disorders but also to deliver profound arguments that convince policy makers, for example, to reduce toxic wastes, fumes and plastics which pose threats to our health.
