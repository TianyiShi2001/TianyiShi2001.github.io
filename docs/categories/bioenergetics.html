<p><strong>What effects do the intensity and duration of exercise have on fuel selection by mammalian muscle?</strong></p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>During exercise, glucose and fatty acids are the fuels used by the muscle. Their origin and relative contribution depend on the intensity and duration of exercise, as well as on characteristics of individuals such as the level of physical training.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Overview</h1>
<p>As shown in Figure 1, muscle contraction during exercise is powered by oxidation of glucose and fatty acids derived from a number of sources.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:powering-the-muscle"></span>
<img src="../img/powering-the-muscle.png" alt="Sources of fuel during exercise. (1) white adipose tissue lipolysis; (2) intramuscular triglycerides (IMTG); (3) plasma TG (mainly contained in VLDL synthesised by the liver); (4) mucle glycogenolysis; blood glucose derived from liver glycogenolysis (5) and gluconeogenesis (6)." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.1: Sources of fuel during exercise. (1) white adipose tissue lipolysis; (2) intramuscular triglycerides (IMTG); (3) plasma TG (mainly contained in VLDL synthesised by the liver); (4) mucle glycogenolysis; blood glucose derived from liver glycogenolysis (5) and gluconeogenesis (6).
</p>
</div>
<p>Immediately after the onset of exercise (0-30 s) energy is derived predominantly from anaerobic respiration. After this period, both excercise intensity and duration determine the choice of fuel used for oxidation. As shown in Figure 2, during the first 30 minutes of a low-intensity exercise bout, the vast majority of fuel used by muscle is plasma NEFA (non-esterified fatty acids) originated from adipose lipolysis with tiny contributions from IMTG (intramuscular triglyceride) and plasma glucose. For moderately intense exercise, the contribution from fat is lower: plasma NEFA and IMTG each represent about 25% of total energy expenditure, and glycogen and plasma glucose account for the remaining 40% and 10%. For high-intensity exercise, the contribution from muscle glycogen is even higher (60%), and fat and glucose represents 30% and 10% of the total, respectively. Overall, as exercise intensity increases, carbohydrates (especially muscle glycogen) progressively becomes the preferred fuel over triglyceride-derived fuel. As for TG-derived fuel, the ratio of IMTG to plasma NEFA is greatest during moderately intense exercise and lowest during low-intensity excercise. These are explained in detail later.</p>
<p>Figure 2 also shows that, during prolonged (low- or moderate-intensity) exercise, the contribution from plasma NEFA increases and the contribution from other fuels decreases, regardless of exercise intensity. This is due to the large amount of TG reserve in adipose tissue and the gradual depletion of other fuels.</p>

<div id="glycogen-and-glucose" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Glycogen and Glucose</h2>
<div id="blood-glucose" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Blood Glucose</h3>
<p>During exercise, catecholamines stimulates pancreatic <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> cells to secrete glucagon, which in turn promtotes hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Both processes release glucose into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Blood glucose is the predominant source of carbohydrate for oxidation in muscle. Its absolute amount of usage increases as excercise intensity increases (though proportionally remains largely unchanged), which is mediated by an increaed sensitivity to insulin (in part due to utilisation of IMTG) and thus increased translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface membrane.</p>
</div>
<div id="regulation-of-glycogenolysis" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Regulation of Glycogenolysis</h3>
<p>Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and phosphorylase kinase (PhK) are central to the regulation of glycogenolysis. Activated PhK phosphorylates GP, thus converting it from the inactive <em>b</em> form to the active <em>a</em> form. GP in its <em>a</em> form then phosphorolyses glycogen, releasing glucose 1-phosphase available for oxidation.</p>
<p>PhK is activated (1) by phosphorylation on <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> subunits by PKA and (2) by binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> subunit. PKA is activated upon catecholamine (mostly adrenaline) binding to cell surface receptors (via G<sub>s</sub>, adenylyl cyclase, and cAMP), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released upon muscle contraction (stimulated by acetylcholine).</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> released upon muscle contraction results in a burst of glycogenolysis. The large amount of glycogen breakdown exceeds muscle’s energy requirement and capacity of TCA cycle, resulting in accumulation of lactate. This probably explains the short period of anaerobic respiration at the onset of exercise. After a few minutes, the activation of phosphorylase reverses by a mechanism that is not fully understood.</p>
<p>Myocytes also respond, via <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> adrenergic receptors, to catecholamines that are produced proportionally to exercise intensity. This results in activation of PKA (via G<sub>s</sub>, AC and cAMP), which in turn activates glycogenolysis.</p>
<p>The rate of glycogenolysis also depends on availability of P<sub>i</sub>, the substrate of glycogen phosphorylase. At rest and during mild exercise, fatty acid oxidation is capable of generating sufficient ATP, resulting in low P<sub>i</sub> concentration. Availability of P<sub>i</sub> increases as exercise intensity increases because the rate of ATP hydrolysis exceeds the rate of convertion from ADP and P<sub>i</sub> back to ATP by oxidation of fatty acids (and plasma glucose).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="fatty-acids" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Fatty Acids</h2>
<p>During exercise, the usage of fatty acids has an important role of delaying the onset of glycogen depletion and hypoglycemia. Its contribution to total energy expenditure increases as excercise proceeds. However, its usage is limited during strenuous exercise.</p>
<div id="adipose-tissue-lipolysis-and-plasma-nefa" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Adipose Tissue Lipolysis and Plasma NEFA</h3>
<p>Compared to resting conditions, adipose tissue lipolysis occurs at a higher rate during mild- or moderate-intensity exercise. This is mainly mediated by increased <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-adrenergic receptor activation by catecholamines released by the adrenal gland upon sympathetic nerve stimulation. Exercise also increases blood flow in adipose tissue (which prevents toxic regional accumulation of fatty acids) and in muscle, thus promoting transport of NEFA to myocytes. Passive uptake of NEFA by myocytes, which is proportional to plasma NEFA concentration, is thus increased. AMPK, which is activated upon transition from rest to exercise and during prolonged exercise, phosphorylates ACC2 and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, inhibiting the former and activating the latter, thus resulting in a decrease of malonyl-CoA concentration and hence releasing CPT-1 from inhibition. This promotes transport of fatty acids into mitochondria for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-oxidation in muscle cells.</p>
<p>As the exercise intensity continue to increase, however, oxidation of NEFA derived from adipose tissue lipolysis in muscle decreases. This is in part caused by decreased rate of lipolysis due to lactate (through activation of an orphan GPCR, GPR81). Lactate can also increase re-esterification of fatty acids to TG in the liver. Raising plasma fatty acid concentrations by intravenously infusing a lipid emulsion and heparin during the exercise bout increases plasma NEFA oxidation by about 30% but does not completely restore it to the rate observed during moderate-intensity exercise. Thus, high-intensity exercise also decreases the capacity of skeletal muscle to oxidise fatty acids, which is in part caused by increased glycogen catabolism. As more acetyl-CoA concentration are produced via glycogen catabolism, they are converted to malonyl-CoA by ACC2 located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, and the malonyl-CoA then inhibits CPT-1 and hence fatty acid oxidation.</p>
</div>
<div id="intramuscular-triacylglycerol-imtg" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Intramuscular Triacylglycerol (IMTG)</h3>
<p>Within myocytes, there are lipid droplets that stores TG. Their usage during exercise can be calculated by subtracting plasma fatty acid oxidation (determined by isotope tracers) from whole-body fat oxidation (determined by indirect calorimetry).</p>
<p>IMTG use is stimulated by catecholamines via <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> adrenergic receptors. This is supported by the finding that pharmarcological blockage of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 + \beta_2\)</span> prevents the usage of IMTG.</p>
</div>
<div id="plasma-tg-vldl-tg" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Plasma TG (VLDL-TG)</h3>
<p>The liver takes up plasma NEFA and glycerol and use some of them to resynthesise TG. These TG are packaged in VLDL and released into the bloodstream. Muscle can break down some VLDL by lipoprotein lipase and oxidise the resulting fatty acids. However, this only contributes to a small fraction of energy usage during exercise and might be more important for replenishing IMTG stores after exercise.</p>

<h1>SAQ</h1>
<p><strong>Using the physical chemistry principles, discuss factors which are contributed in the favourability of an electron transfer reactions between cofactors.</strong></p>
<p>The reduction potential, <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, is used to quantify favourability of gaining electrons (getting reduced). <span class="math inline">\(E^{\circ\prime}\)</span> is the reduction potential measured under biological standard conditions (i.e. pH = 7, oxidised and reduced species are 1M, 298K and 1 atm). When concentrations of the oxidised and reduced species differ:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E=E^{\circ\prime} + \dfrac{RT}{zF}\ln\left(\dfrac{\text{[reduced]}}{\text{[oxidised]}}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>For two half equations, A<sup>+</sup> + <span class="math inline">\(e^-\rightarrow\)</span> A and <span class="math inline">\(\text{B} + e^- \rightarrow\)</span> B<sup>-</sup> with <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> respectively, a full reaction equation can be constructed, which can be A<sup>+</sup> + B<sup>-</sup> <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> A + B (with <span class="math inline">\(E_\text{r}\)</span> = x - y) or the reverse (with <span class="math inline">\(E_\text{r}\)</span> = y - x); the one with positive <span class="math inline">\(E_\text{r}\)</span> (reaction potential) will actually occur.</p>
<p>Electron transfers occur because electrons are moving down to a lower energy level. In simple cases, atoms with greater electronegativity have greater affinity for electrons and thus a more positive reduction potential, and <em>vice versa</em>. This is the case for strong oxidants F<sub>2</sub> and Cl<sub>2</sub> (electronegative; highly positive <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>) and strong reductants Li and Na (electropositive, highly negative <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>). In most cases, however, other factors, such as change in state, conformation, or interactions with water, will significantly affect the reduction potential. For example, Cu and Ag is less electronegative than hydrogen, but their monovalent ions are more easily reduced than H<sup>+</sup>. That is mainly because the formation of metallic solid upon reduction is highly exergonic. Similarly, although the atoms involved in the redox reactions in the repiratory chain are not variable (Cu and Fe), they have different <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> due to the enviornment (e.g. proximity to the P/N face, identity of ligands).</p>
<p>The series of cofactors along the electron transport chain have a generally steadily increasing <span class="math inline">\(E^{\circ\prime}\)</span>, so electrons are moved toward increasingly lower energy levels. There are some exceptions to this trend, but <span class="math inline">\(E_\text{r}\)</span> would be made positive in these cases by making a concentration difference (usually by means of ‘pulling’ from the next redox centre with favourable <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>).</p>
<p>While the thermodynamic feasibility of the redox reactions is solely determined by the difference in the reduction potentials (which is proportional to Gibbs free energy), the kinetics (rates) are affected by more factors.</p>
<p>Electrons are passed from one centre to another by <em>tunnelling</em>. Specifically, the wave function for an electron in the donor shows there is a probability that the electron will be found at an acceptor some distance away. <em>Tunnelling</em> is independent of temperature and orientation of chemical groups, but is instead influenced by 1) the distance between the electron donor and acceptor, 2) the redox potential difference, <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, and 3) the ‘reorganisation energy’, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.</p>
<p>Within each respiratory complex, the redox centres are close to each other—no more than 14Å apart (the maxium 14Å is found between N5 and N6a Fe-S clusters in complex I). Ubiquinone has binding sites in complex I (II) and III in close proximity to the redox centres from which it receives and to which it delivers electrons, and the same is true for cyt <em>c</em> (which binds to complex III and IV). This arrangement makes the numerous electron transfer steps not the limiting factor in the respiratory chain.</p>

<div id="two-proton-translocation-models-loop-and-pump" class="section level2">
<h2>Two Proton Translocation Models: Loop and Pump</h2>
<p>Mechanisms of coupling redox reactions to proton translocation can be classified into two models: the chemical loop, and the conformational pump.</p>
<p>In the loop model shown in Figure <a href="#fig:loop">1</a>, the hydrogens (protons plus electrons) from the substrate (AH<sub>2</sub>) first reduce an mediator molecule (B) on the N side, and this mediator is reoxidised, forcing protons to be released to the P side via one pathway and electrons to flow back to the N side via another pathway. The electrons then reduce another species (C) using protons from the N side. This mechanism is employed in the respiratory chain, where ubiquinone serves as the ‘mediator’ molecule and ETC components from Rieske Fe-S protein in complex III to Cu<sub>B</sub> centre in complex IV as the electron pathway. The number of protons translocated in this way has to follow a fixed stoichiometry (i.e. 1 proton per electron). (Not shown in this diagram, the reduction of Q near the N face driven by QH<sub>2</sub> oxidation near the P face in the Q cycle is also an example of this mechanism.)</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The key idea of the pump mechanism is the conformational change driven by redox reactions. Conformational change can lead to alternating proton accessibility from the two faces and differential pKa values of proton binding sites, resulting in proton translocation (explained in Figure <a href="#fig:pump">2</a>). The number of protons pumped in this way does not have to follow a fixed stoichiometry within the thermodynamic constraints (i.e. <em>E</em><sub>r</sub>/n must be greater than ∆p). This mechanism is thought to be employed in complex I and IV of the respiratory chain. However, recent studies have shown that complex IV may adopt a unique mechanism, as explained later in this essay.</p>

<h2>Complex I</h2>
<p>As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:3m9s">3</a>, bacterial complex I (from <em>Thermus thermophilus</em>) comprises two domains. The hydrophobic, transmembrane domain (a.k.a. membrane arm) has a proton-translocating P-module and subunit NuoH. The hydrophilic domain (a.k.a. peripheral domain) has an NADH-oxidising dehydrogenase module (N-module) which feeds electrons to the electron-transferring chain of Fe-S clusters, and the connecting Q-module, which reduces ubiquinone. Mammalian mitochondrial complex I is similar in gross organisation and function, although it possesses more subunits.</p>

<p>At the centre of each antiporter-like subunit (NuoLMN), two transmembrane helices are ‘broken’ and each have a kink known as a ‘π-bulge’, and there is a lysine residue in this region (Glu407 for NuoM) critical to proton pumping, confirmed by mutagenesis studies. There are two symmetry-related plausible proton channels lined by hydrophilic/charged residues, one connecting the central lysine on one broken TM to the P face and the other connecting lysine of the other TM to the N face.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:proton-path">5</a>, NuoL/M/N may work by using conformational changes (induced from the hydrophilic domain) to transfer a proton from the lysines on the helix with N half channel to the other lysine (or Glu in NuoM) on the helix with P half channel, and if the pK<sub>a</sub>s of the two lysines differ, this leads to unidirectional proton transport. This mechanism is in accordance with the general scheme shown in Figure <a href="#fig:pump">2</a>.</p>

<h3>Coupling</h3>
<p>It is debated how the redox reactions in the hydrophilic domain triggers conformational change, and how this conformational change is transmitted along the hydrophobic domain.</p>
<p>Some features of the Fe-S centre N2 (the last Fe-S centre in complex I) led to hypotheses in which N2 plays a major role in pumping protons<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, but currently, the mainstream idea is that the initial conformational change in the hydrophilic domain is contributed mostly by the reduction of ubiquinone.</p>
<p>As claimed by <span class="citation">Wirth et al. (2016)</span>, reduction of ubiquinone is a two-step process, where the Q binding site cycles between a conformation that permits electron transfer (E-state), and a conformation that permits proton transfer (P-state) onto intermediates of ubiquinone. The conformational change associated with this controlled process is assumed to initiate proton translocation.</p>
<p>It was originally suggested that the horizontal HL helix (see Figure <a href="#fig:3m9s">3</a>) in NuoL could move horizontally like a piston to transmit conformational change along the hydrophobic domain<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, but now, after realising the similarity between NuoH and NuoL/M/N, it is thought that conformational changes associated with π-bulges in the mid-membrane parts are transmitted laterally to NuoN/M/L <span class="citation">(Nicholls and Ferguson 2013)</span>, and, as suggested by <span class="citation">Wirth et al. (2016)</span>, this is achieved by electrostatic coupling in the central hydrophilic axis.</p>
<p>As I mentioned last week <span class="citation">(Shi 2019)</span>, as there is no complete evidence demonstrating how complex I proton pump works, other hypotheses exists, including a radical one recently proposed by <span class="citation">Morelli et al. (2019)</span>, which emphasises the elusiveness of the ‘proton entrance half channel’ (from the middle Lys to the N face) contrasted by the clarity of the ‘proton exit half channel’ (to the P face). Together with another piece of evidence that an obvious proton tunnelling is found at the centre of complex I, Morelli drafted an lateral mechanism of proton circuiting, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:Morelli2019">6</a></p>

<h2>Complex III (cyt <em>bc<sub>1</sub></em> complex)</h2>
<p>Complex III is a homodimer, with each monomer consisting of three subunits: cytochrome b, the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, and cytochrome c1. Each monomer has two binding sites for ubiquinone, called Q<sup>N</sup> and Q<sup>P</sup>, indicating their proximities to two opposite faces.</p>
<p>Uniquinone oxidation and proton translocation is coupled in the Q cycle, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:ciii">7</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>In stage 1, QH<sub>2</sub> binds to Q<sub>N</sub> of one dimer and a Q binds to the Q<sub>P</sub> of another dimer. The QH<sub>2</sub> at Q<sub>N</sub> is oxidised by two electron acceptors in two steps: the first electron is accepted by the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and passed though cytochrome c<sub>1</sub> and finally to cytochrome c, and second other electron is accepted by cytochrome b, passed through its two hemes (b<sub>H</sub> and b<sub>L</sub>) and finally to the Q at Q<sub>P</sub> on the other monomer, forming semiquinone. The two protons of QH<sub>2</sub> are released into the P face (the molecular details is unclear).</p>
<p>In stage 2, the same process is repeated—one QH<sub>2</sub> is oxidised to Q, its protons released and electrons passed 1) onto one cytochrome c and 2) to the other side—but this time the electron acceptor on the other side is semiquinone. Acceptance of an electron by semiquinone, and the addition of two protons from the matrix, produces QH2.</p>

<h2>Complex IV</h2>
<p>Complex IV (cytochrome oxidase) accepts electrons from cytochrome c to reduce oxygen to water and pumps 2 electrons to the P face.</p>
<p>Previous X-ray studies suggested that complex IV exists as dimers with each monomer comprising 13 subunits <span class="citation">(Tsukihara et al. 1996)</span>. However, it was recently shown by <span class="citation">Zong et al. (2018)</span> that complex IV is actually a 14-subunit monomer, and dimerisation was an artifect due to the dissociation of NDUFA4 subunit during the detergent-based purification steps before crystallisation (NDUFA4 hampers dimerisation).</p>

The electron is then passed onto haem <em>a</em>, and then to haem <em>a</em><sub>3</sub>-Cu<sub>B</sub> binuclear centre, where an oxygen molecule is bound. 4 electrons from cyt c and 4 protons from the N phase are required to reduce one oxygen molecule to two water molecules. Cu<sub>B</sub> has three His ligands, and the forth empty coordination site mediates oxygen reduction by holding the intermediates (its malfunction leads to generation of ROS).</p>

<h3>Pump mechanism</h3>
<p>For each pair of electrons, 2 H<sup>+</sup> from N phase is consumed to make water and another 2 H<sup>+</sup> is pumped intot he P phase.</p>
<p>According to a recent review by <span class="citation">Wikström and Sharma (2018)</span>, the favoured charge-conpensation mechanism is as follows: (see Figure <a href="#fig:civ-p">9</a>)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>when an electron is transferred from haem <em>a</em> to the haem <em>a</em><sub>3</sub>-Cu<sub>B</sub> binulear centre (BNC), one proton from Glu242 is loaded onto the ‘proton loading site’ (PLS<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>). This is a purely electrostatic event (not acid-base, as pK<sub>a</sub> of PLS is not high enough).</li>
<li>reprotonated Glu242 transfers another proton to BNC, annihilating the -ve charge in BNC, so H<sup>+</sup> on PLS can leave. There must be a barrier preventing H<sup>+</sup> flowing back to the N side, which can be achieved by raising the energy of the transition state of proton transfer between the Glu242 and PLS.</li>

<div id="components-of-pmf-in-chloroplasts-and-mitochondria" class="section level2">
<h2>Components of pmf in chloroplasts and mitochondria</h2>
<p>In mitochondria, the major component of protomotive force (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta p\)</span>) is the membrane potential (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta \Psi\)</span>), while in chloroplasts it is <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>pH. This is caused by the physiology of these organelles and the electrical properties of membranes.</p>
<p>In chloroplasts, when protons are being pumped into the thylakoid space, the developed membrane potential is balanced out by efflux of K<sup>+</sup> and influx of Cl<sup>–</sup> through voltage-gated channels, such as KEA3 K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter and voltage-gated VCCN1 Cl<sup>–</sup> channel, so it results in a pure pH difference. TPK3 was originally thought to be one of such channels but was recently shown to be not critical <span class="citation">(Höhner et al. 2019)</span>. There are not many enzymes in the thylakoid lumen, so a low pH is not unsafe. In addition, the high H<sup>+</sup> concentration has regulatroy functions. <span class="citation">(Höhner et al. 2019)</span></p>
<p>If mitochondria were allowed to develop such a pH difference (very basic matrix), this would denature the numerous enzymes, such as those involved in <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-oxidation and TCA cycle, that operate inside the matrix. In mitochondria, there are not such ion channels to counteract change in <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \Psi\)</span>, so proton translocation results in charge imbalance, leading to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \Psi\)</span> change<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, and a significant membrane potential can be established with only minuscule amount of charge movement.This can be explained by the low capacitance of the membrane. Capacitance is the amount of charge separation needed to develop unit voltage difference, i.e.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C=\dfrac{Q}{V}\]</span></p>
<p>Given a constant <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta \Psi\)</span>), lower capacitance means smaller charge difference is required to build up that voltage difference.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:capacitance">10</a> shows a simple parallel-plate capacitor, which is analogous to mitochondrial inner membrane.</p>

<p>The electrical capacitance of such a plate can be calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C = \dfrac{\epsilon A}{d}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is the permittivity of the plate, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the surface area and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the distance separating charges. For mitochondrial inner membrane, although <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{A}{d}\)</span> is large, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is very small, so the overall capacitance is small.</p>

<p>According to <span class="citation">Liang et al.

According to a model built by <span class="citation">Mannella, Lederer, and Jafri (2013)</span>, one mitochondria with matrix volume of <span class="math inline">\(9.6\times10^4\)</span> nm^3 would have a inner membrane (cristae) surface area of <span class="math inline">\(5.76\times10^6\)</span> nm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
