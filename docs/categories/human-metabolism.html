<p><strong>What effects do the intensity and duration of exercise have on fuel selection by mammalian muscle?</strong></p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>During exercise, glucose and fatty acids are the fuels used by the muscle. Their origin and relative contribution depend on the intensity and duration of exercise, as well as on characteristics of individuals such as the level of physical training.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Overview</h1>
<p>As shown in Figure 1, muscle contraction during exercise is powered by oxidation of glucose and fatty acids derived from a number of sources.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:powering-the-muscle"></span>
<img src="../img/powering-the-muscle.png" alt="Sources of fuel during exercise. (1) white adipose tissue lipolysis; (2) intramuscular triglycerides (IMTG); (3) plasma TG (mainly contained in VLDL synthesised by the liver); (4) mucle glycogenolysis; blood glucose derived from liver glycogenolysis (5) and gluconeogenesis (6)." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Immediately after the onset of exercise (0-30 s) energy is derived predominantly from anaerobic respiration. After this period, both excercise intensity and duration determine the choice of fuel used for oxidation. As shown in Figure 2, during the first 30 minutes of a low-intensity exercise bout, the vast majority of fuel used by muscle is plasma NEFA (non-esterified fatty acids) originated from adipose lipolysis with tiny contributions from IMTG (intramuscular triglyceride) and plasma glucose. For moderately intense exercise, the contribution from fat is lower: plasma NEFA and IMTG each represent about 25% of total energy expenditure, and glycogen and plasma glucose account for the remaining 40% and 10%. For high-intensity exercise, the contribution from muscle glycogen is even higher (60%), and fat and glucose represents 30% and 10% of the total, respectively. Overall, as exercise intensity increases, carbohydrates (especially muscle glycogen) progressively becomes the preferred fuel over triglyceride-derived fuel. As for TG-derived fuel, the ratio of IMTG to plasma NEFA is greatest during moderately intense exercise and lowest during low-intensity excercise. These are explained in detail later.</p>
<p>Figure 2 also shows that, during prolonged (low- or moderate-intensity) exercise, the contribution from plasma NEFA increases and the contribution from other fuels decreases, regardless of exercise intensity. This is due to the large amount of TG reserve in adipose tissue and the gradual depletion of other fuels.</p>

<div id="glycogen-and-glucose" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Glycogen and Glucose</h2>
<div id="blood-glucose" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Blood Glucose</h3>
<p>During exercise, catecholamines stimulates pancreatic <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> cells to secrete glucagon, which in turn promtotes hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Both processes release glucose into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Blood glucose is the predominant source of carbohydrate for oxidation in muscle. Its absolute amount of usage increases as excercise intensity increases (though proportionally remains largely unchanged), which is mediated by an increaed sensitivity to insulin (in part due to utilisation of IMTG) and thus increased translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface membrane.</p>
</div>
<div id="regulation-of-glycogenolysis" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Regulation of Glycogenolysis</h3>
<p>Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and phosphorylase kinase (PhK) are central to the regulation of glycogenolysis. Activated PhK phosphorylates GP, thus converting it from the inactive <em>b</em> form to the active <em>a</em> form. GP in its <em>a</em> form then phosphorolyses glycogen, releasing glucose 1-phosphase available for oxidation.</p>
<p>PhK is activated (1) by phosphorylation on <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> subunits by PKA and (2) by binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> subunit. PKA is activated upon catecholamine (mostly adrenaline) binding to cell surface receptors (via G<sub>s</sub>, adenylyl cyclase, and cAMP), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released upon muscle contraction (stimulated by acetylcholine).</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> released upon muscle contraction results in a burst of glycogenolysis. The large amount of glycogen breakdown exceeds muscle’s energy requirement and capacity of TCA cycle, resulting in accumulation of lactate. This probably explains the short period of anaerobic respiration at the onset of exercise. After a few minutes, the activation of phosphorylase reverses by a mechanism that is not fully understood.</p>
<p>Myocytes also respond, via <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> adrenergic receptors, to catecholamines that are produced proportionally to exercise intensity. This results in activation of PKA (via G<sub>s</sub>, AC and cAMP), which in turn activates glycogenolysis.</p>
<p>The rate of glycogenolysis also depends on availability of P<sub>i</sub>, the substrate of glycogen phosphorylase. At rest and during mild exercise, fatty acid oxidation is capable of generating sufficient ATP, resulting in low P<sub>i</sub> concentration. Availability of P<sub>i</sub> increases as exercise intensity increases because the rate of ATP hydrolysis exceeds the rate of convertion from ADP and P<sub>i</sub> back to ATP by oxidation of fatty acids (and plasma glucose).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="fatty-acids" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Fatty Acids</h2>
<p>During exercise, the usage of fatty acids has an important role of delaying the onset of glycogen depletion and hypoglycemia. Its contribution to total energy expenditure increases as excercise proceeds. However, its usage is limited during strenuous exercise.</p>
<div id="adipose-tissue-lipolysis-and-plasma-nefa" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Adipose Tissue Lipolysis and Plasma NEFA</h3>
<p>Compared to resting conditions, adipose tissue lipolysis occurs at a higher rate during mild- or moderate-intensity exercise. This is mainly mediated by increased <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-adrenergic receptor activation by catecholamines released by the adrenal gland upon sympathetic nerve stimulation. Exercise also increases blood flow in adipose tissue (which prevents toxic regional accumulation of fatty acids) and in muscle, thus promoting transport of NEFA to myocytes. Passive uptake of NEFA by myocytes, which is proportional to plasma NEFA concentration, is thus increased. AMPK, which is activated upon transition from rest to exercise and during prolonged exercise, phosphorylates ACC2 and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, inhibiting the former and activating the latter, thus resulting in a decrease of malonyl-CoA concentration and hence releasing CPT-1 from inhibition. This promotes transport of fatty acids into mitochondria for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-oxidation in muscle cells.</p>
<p>As the exercise intensity continue to increase, however, oxidation of NEFA derived from adipose tissue lipolysis in muscle decreases. This is in part caused by decreased rate of lipolysis due to lactate (through activation of an orphan GPCR, GPR81). Lactate can also increase re-esterification of fatty acids to TG in the liver. Raising plasma fatty acid concentrations by intravenously infusing a lipid emulsion and heparin during the exercise bout increases plasma NEFA oxidation by about 30% but does not completely restore it to the rate observed during moderate-intensity exercise. Thus, high-intensity exercise also decreases the capacity of skeletal muscle to oxidise fatty acids, which is in part caused by increased glycogen catabolism. As more acetyl-CoA concentration are produced via glycogen catabolism, they are converted to malonyl-CoA by ACC2 located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, and the malonyl-CoA then inhibits CPT-1 and hence fatty acid oxidation.</p>
</div>
<div id="intramuscular-triacylglycerol-imtg" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Intramuscular Triacylglycerol (IMTG)</h3>
<p>Within myocytes, there are lipid droplets that stores TG. Their usage during exercise can be calculated by subtracting plasma fatty acid oxidation (determined by isotope tracers) from whole-body fat oxidation (determined by indirect calorimetry).</p>
<p>IMTG use is stimulated by catecholamines via <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> adrenergic receptors. This is supported by the finding that pharmarcological blockage of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 + \beta_2\)</span> prevents the usage of IMTG.</p>
</div>
<div id="plasma-tg-vldl-tg" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Plasma TG (VLDL-TG)</h3>
<p>The liver takes up plasma NEFA and glycerol and use some of them to resynthesise TG. These TG are packaged in VLDL and released into the bloodstream. Muscle can break down some VLDL by lipoprotein lipase and oxidise the resulting fatty acids. However, this only contributes to a small fraction of energy usage during exercise and might be more important for replenishing IMTG stores after exercise.</p>

<p><strong>How does insulin regulate the pathways for the conversion of body fat into ketone bodies? Why are ketone bodies overproduced in uncontrolled diabetes and what are the metabolic consequences.</strong></p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Production of ketone bodies (ketogenesis) occurs in the liver (and the kidneys) as an response to prevent hypoglycemia during starvation, and this process is normally suppressed and stimulated by insulin and glucagon, respectively. In addition to its physiological role in fasting, ketogenesis also has high activity in diabetes patients, which may lead to the potentially lethal condition called diabetic ketoacidosis.</p>
</div>
<div id="regulation-of-ketogenesis-by-insulin" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Regulation of Ketogenesis by Insulin</h1>
<p>Insulin suppresses ketogenesis by several mechanisms.</p>
<p>The steps of ketogenesis are breifly shown in Figure <a href="#fig:ketogenesis-brief-diagram">2.1</a>. There are three control points by which ketogenesis can be regulated by insulin: (1) adipocyte lipolysis, (2) mitochondrial fatty acid entry in ketogenic cells (mainly hepatocytes), (3) channeling of Acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) into the ketogenic pathway, and (4) mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMG-CoA synthase).</p>

</div>
<div id="adipocyte-lipolysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Adipocyte Lipolysis</h2>
<p>The major source molecules for ketogenesis are fatty acids obtained via lipolysis in white adipose tissues. Lipolysis involves the sequential hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (TAG) into 3 non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and glycerol by adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and monoglyceride lipase (MGL). Activation of ATGL and HSL are dependent on PKA, which is activated by cAMP that are produced when catecholamines bind to cell-surface <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> adrenergic receptors.</p>
<p>Insulin is a potent inhibitor of lipolysis. It activates PKB via IRS and PI3K, and PKB in turn phosphorylates and activates phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE-3B). PDB-3B decyclises cAMP, thus diminishing PKA, and thus lipolytic, activity (Figure <a href="#fig:ketogenesis-insulin-detail">2.2</a>). During starvation, insulin levels are low, and adipocyte lipolysis is released from inhibition. Adipocytes are then able to release NEFA into bloodstream.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="regulation-of-cpt1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Regulation of CPT1</h2>
<p>Once NEFA molecules arrive at hepatocytes, they are first broken down into AcCoA via <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-oxidation before conversion into ketone bodies. Long chain fatty acids needs the carnitine shuttle to enter mitochondria where <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-oxidation takes place, and thus the first enzyme of this shuttling system, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) is the rate limiting step and is under control. CPT1 is inhibited by malonyl CoA, which is the lipogenetic precursor produced by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Insulin activates protein phosphotase 2A (PP2A, which is also activated by xylulose 5-phosphate during fed state), which dephosphorylates and activates ACC, thus promoting lipogenesis and suppressing <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-oxidation and ketogenesis (Figure <a href="#fig:ketogenesis-insulin-detail">2.2</a>).</p>
<p>During starvation when insulin levels are low, the high fatty acid concentration in hepatocytes activates the transcription factor PPAR<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> (activated by direct binding of fatty acids to PPAR<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>), which in turn promotes transcription of several enzymes involved in lipid catabolism, including CPT1.</p>
</div>
<div id="channeling-of-acetyl-coa-into-ketogenesis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Channeling of Acetyl-CoA into Ketogenesis</h2>
<p>AcCoA produced from NEFA via <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-oxidation can either enter the Krebs cycle or the ketogenesis pathway. When the rate of production of AcCoA exceeds the capacity of citrate synthesis (when there is insufficient oxaloacetate), the surplus becomes the substrate for ketogenesis. This situation occurs during starvation, when insulin levels are low and glucagon levels are high, and gluconeogenesis active. Glucagon has several mechanisms to promote gluconeogenesis (and suppress glycolysis). For example, it activates PKA, which in turn activates the transcription factor CREB, which promotes transcription of gluconeogenenic enzymes such as PEP carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Insulin, on the contary, suppresses gluconeogenesis. For instance, it activates PKB, which in turn phosphorylates and thus inactivates FOXO1, which is a transcription factor that promotes the transcription of a similar set of gluconeogenic enzymes. Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis and thus ketogenesis.</p>
</div>
<div id="mitochondrial-hmg-coa-synthase" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Mitochondrial HMG-CoA Synthase</h2>
<p>Mitochondrial HMG-CoA catalyses the irreversible step in ketogenesis, and therefore is a site of control.</p>
<p>Insulin promotes glycolysis and increases flux through the Krebs cycle. One of the Krebs cycle intermediate, succinyl-CoA, inactivates mitochondrial HMG-CoA by succinylation. Glucagon, on the contrary, activates gluconeogenesis, which causes depletion of Krebs cycle intermediates including succinyl-CoA, thus activating ketogenesis.</p>
<p>In addition, the transcription factor PPAR<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> described previously also activates transcription of HMG-CoA synthase.</p>

<div id="aetiology-of-diabetes" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Aetiology of Diabetes</h2>
<p>Diabetes is characterised by insufficient insulin activity, which could be caused by either lack of insulin production or insulin resistance in target cells. Most diabetes cases fall into two categories, type 1 and type 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>Type 1 diabetes is caused by autoimmunity agaist pancreatic <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> cells, which leads to their death and inadequacy of insulin. The primary risk factor for type 1 diabetes is genetic, although several environmental risk factors, such as infection by viruses that show tropism to pancreatic islets.</li>
<li>Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance, but reduction of insulin production and number of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> cells may also be implicated as the disease advances. Type 2 diabetes also has genetic risk factors, but environmental factors, such as sedentarity and obesity, are more important.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whichever the type, ketogenesis is hyperactive in diabetes patients (although generally more severe in type 1) due to inadequate insulin activity.</p>
</div>
<div id="overproduction-of-ketone-bodies" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Overproduction of Ketone Bodies</h2>
<p>Given the fact that insulin suppresses ketogenesis and insulin activity is decreased in diabetic patients, it is easy to comprehend why ketone bodies are overproduced in diabetic individuals.</p>
<p>Lack of insulin activity upon adipocytes leads to uncontrolled lipolysis and subsequent release of non-esterified fatty acids. As fatty acids enter the liver, they are shuttled into mitochondria, broken down into acetyl-CoA via <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-oxidation and converted to ketone bodies. This process is facilitated by the low insulin activity, which activates gluconeogenesis (e.g. via FOXO1-induced transcription of gluconeogenenic enzymes and phosphorylation of PFK2/FBPase2 bifunctional enzyme), which in turn releases the rate-limiting enzyme, HMG-CoA from succinylation inhibition and reduces usage of acetyl-CoA in Krebs cycle. The low insulin activity also inhibits ACC, thus activating CPT1 and hence <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-oxidation. The high fatty acid concentration also leads to activation of PPAR<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, which promotes transcription of ketogenic enzymes such as CPT-1 and HMG-CoA synthatase.</p>
</div>
<div id="consequences-of-ketoacidosis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Consequences of Ketoacidosis</h2>
<p>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) the most common acute emergency in diabetes patients. It is a potentially lethal condition that is characterised by lowered blood pH due to accumulation of acidic ketone bodies (acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate). DKA is caused by lack of insulin and thus occurs mostly in uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (DKA is not commonly seen in type 2 diabetes, because even a tiny amount of insulin activity would inhibit ketogenesis; however, there is a small proportion of “ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes”). Often, DKA is triggered by stress or illness, which are associated with increase of ketogenesis-promoting hormones, glucagon and catecholamines.</p>
<p>Ketoacidosis has several consequences, as described below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kussmaul breathing: initally, bicarbonate ions buffur protons dissociated from ketone bodies, but this buffering system quickly becomes overwhelmed. To compensate, blood CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is reduced by deep, regular breaths known as Kussmaul breathing.</li>
<li>Hypovolaemia: hyperglycemia and ketonaemia results in excretion of glucose and ketone bodies (which normally should be absorbed) in urine. Since they are osmotically active, their presence in urine causes osmotic diuresis, which further leads to hypovolaemia (decrease in body fluid volume).</li>
<li>Electrolyte disturvance: as the the plasma pH falls, extracellular protons are exchanged for intracellular potassium ions. In addition, owing to hypovolaemia, the aldosterone concentration increases to retain water, but this hormone also leads to excretion of K<sup>+</sup> and retention of Na<sup>+</sup>.</li>
