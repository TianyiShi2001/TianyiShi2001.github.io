<p>Presentation see <a href="../thioredoxin-presentation/">here</a></p>
<!--
Thioredoxins are kept in the reduced state by the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase in a NADPH-dependent reaction. 

Plants have an unusually complex complement of Trxs composed of six well-defined types (Trxs f, m, x, y, h, and o) that reside in different cell compartments and function in an array of processes. In 2010 it was discovered for the first time that thioredoxin proteins are able to move from cell to cell, representing a novel form of cellular communication in plants.

Thioredoxins are small ubiquitous proteins with two redox-active cysteine rediuses separated by a pair of amino acids (CXXC)

TRXs *m, f, x, y, z* isoforms are located in the chloroplast, whereas TRXs *o* are mitochondrial and TRX *h* proteins are found in different subcellular compartments.

TRX *h* is the largest TRX gene family in plants, comprising nine different isoforms in Arabidopsis. First isolated from spinach leaves; outisde of the chloroplast. Lack of a transit peptide; initially assumed as solely cytosolic proteins. However, alternative locations were also observed for some of them: plasma membrane, endomembranes (ER & Golgi), mitochondria, and the nucleus. Highly redundant -> difficult to unequivocally determine the function of each TRX *h* isoform

Besides the plastid and mitochondria, Trxs are also found in the cytosol, ER and nucleus of plant cells. Little is known about the function of nucleoredoxins (Nrx) and ER-Trxs, the function of cytosolic Trx *h* has been well documented.

Trx regulates photosynthesis and the TCA cycle in chloroplasts and mitochondria, respectively.

Extraplastidial Trxs hhave been shown to be important in the regulation of different processes such as seed germination, seedling establishment, C, N, and mitochondrial metabolism as well as for plant stress tolerance.

# Trx reduction systems

In extraplastidial compartments the reducing power for Trx reduction is provided by NADPH via NADPH-Trx reductase A (NTRA) and NTRB.

The cytosolic h-type thioredoxins act as key regulators of seed germination and are recycled by NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase

## In seed

Seeds develop in a metabolically active state but become quiescent during maturatiion and drying. This period is characterised by low water content and low metabolic activity as well as the non-enzymatic accumulation of reactive oxygen species (roS) that oxidise proteins and RNA. Oxidation of the thiol groups of cysteine -> changes in protein structure -> lowering solubility and modifying enzyme function -> protection against denaturation and proteolysis as the seed matures and dries.

Under favourable conditions, the seed germinates and thhe seedling draws on stored reserves for growth and development. Large increase in ROS produced as side-products of metabolism. ROS have important signalling roles in germination (but also cause oxidative stress if present in high amounts). The Trx system represents an important waay to regulate ROS in seeds.

## NTR

The NTRA and NTRB are found in both cytosol and mitochondrion, while thhe first has also been found in the nucleuus. NTRA and NTRB are mainly expressed in the cytosol and mitochondrion, respectively.

The NADPH used by the NTR/Trx system is generated by the OPPP through the activity of G6PDH and 6-PGDH, while the souruce of NADPH in the mitoochondion is throuugh the activity of IDH or NADHk. 


# Methods

## Alkylation Labelling


@Kobrehel-1992 applied the fluorescnet alkylating reagent monobromobimane (mBBr) to label free thiol groups in proteins following reduction by Thx. -> discovered that gliadins and glutenin are reduced in vivo during germination

Buchanan and co-workers pioneered the use of proteomics for Trx target identiﬁcation and applied the ﬂuorescent alkylating reagent monobromobimane (mBBr) to label free sulfhydryl (SH) groups in proteins following reduction by Trx [37]. This approach can be applied not only to in vitro but to in vivo reactions as well [2,40,45,46]. To identify targets from peanut seeds, mBBr-labelled proteins were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and ﬂuorescent spots were subjected to trypsin digestion followed by either Edman sequencing or mass spectrometry for protein identiﬁcation

Lane 1, Control: no addition [1.1]; lane 2, GSH/GR/NADPH: GSH, glutathione re- ductase(fromspinachleaves),andNADPH [1.2];lane3,NGS: NADPH, GSH, glutathione reductase (from spinach leaves), and glutaredoxin (from E. coli) [1.6]; lane 4, NTS: NADPH, NTR, and thioredoxin (both proteins from E. coli) [3.9]; lane 5, MET/T(Ec): ,B- mercaptoethanolandthioredoxin(E.co/i)[1.8];lane6,DTT [2.5]; lane7,DTT/T(Ec):DTT andthioredoxin(E.co/i)[3.0];lane8,DTT/ T(W): same as lane 7 except with wheat thioredoxin h [3.6]; lane 9, NGS,-Gliadin: same as lane 3 except without the gliadin protein fraction [0]; lane 10, NTS,-Gliadin: same as lane 4 except without thegliadinproteinfraction[0].

The above findings demonstrate that thioredoxin specifically reduces components of the wheat gliadin and glutenin fractions when tested in vitro. The results, however, provide no indication as to whether these proteins are reduced in vivo during germination-a question that, to our knowledge, has not been previously addressed (cf. 27).

To answer this question, we applied the mBBr/SDS-PAGE technique to monitor the reduction status of proteins in the germinating seed. We observed that reduction of components in the Osborne fractions increased progressively with time and reached a peak after 2 to 3 d germination (Fig. 4). The observed increase in reduction ranged from twofold with the gliadins to threefold with the albumin/globulins and fivefold with the glutenins. The net redox change was most apparent in the gliadins and glutenins found to undergo maximal reduction by thioredoxin, i.e. the 30- to 50-kD gliadins and 30- to 60-kD glutenins (cf. Figs. 1 and 3). The redox changes taking place in these fractions during germination are shown in Figure 5.

## CXXS

@Verdoucq-1999

In the thiol-disulfide exchange reaction, Trx forms a transient intermolecular disufide bond with the target protein involving the more N-terminal cysteine in the active site of Trx (CXXC). Then, the other cysteine (CXXC) attacks the disulﬁde bond of the Trx-target intermediate and releases the reduced target and oxidized Trx.

If instead this second cysteine is replaced with a serine residue through site-directed mutagenesis the Trx loses its capability to reduce the intermolecular disulﬁde bond and the covalent Trx-target complex will be stabilized. This strategy was first applied by Verdoucq et al. [49] who constructed a monocysteinic Trx mutant of A. thaliana Trxh3. The protein was heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisae and it was successfully stabilized in a complex with a peroxiredoxin target protein.

The concept was further developed by Motohashi et al. [50] who immobilized a monocysteinic Trx m on a resin designed to trap targets on a column. Non-targets were removed with the column wash and the trapped targets could subsequently be eluted with a chemical reductant such as DTT (Fig. 3). This approach has been used to identify target proteins from plant mitochondria [51–53], chloroplasts [54], cytosolic extracts [55], and has also been combined with the thiol alkylation approach described above to identify putative target proteins, for example in seeds from M. truncatula [40].

Improved by @Motohashi-2001 (initially applied to Trx m) 
Sepharose 4B resin

@Yamazaki-2004 Target Proteins of the Cytosolic Thioredoxins in Arabidopsis thaliana.
The obtained proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 

The results in this study and recent proteomics studies on the target proteins of chloroplast thioredoxin indicate the versatility and the physiological significance of thioredoxin as reductant in plant cell.

## Differential Labelling of Recombinant BASI (IAA and 4-VP)

- for the well studied chloroplastic thiioredoxins, target disulphide bonds in target enzymes were mainly idenitified by using strategies based on site directed mutagenesis of target proteins
- hoowever, to produce recombinant target proteiins and their mutants would be entremely time-consumiing considering the large number of potential target proteins of thioredoxin h that have been identifieid
- Using mass spectrometry techniques, peptide fragments containing modifications are recognised in hte peptide mass maps according to an exact mass shift from the expected thhiioretical values.
- the thiol and disulphiide forms of cysteine side chains, however, are usually not distinguishhed in MS because complete reduction and alkylation of cysteines are performed during regular sample preparation
- A novel strategy is developed by @Maeda-2005.
- Trypsin digesting
- According to the mass difference of cysteines modified by these two reagents, conversion of disulphides to thiols catalysed by HvTrxh1 was shown in the peptide mass maps of recombinant BASI.

# Rice

Cereals store reserve proteins in the endosperm during maturation of grain. In germination and early seedling development, these proteins are digested to provide nitrogen for growth. In rice and certain other seeds, the major storage proteins are 11S globulins housed in the protein body of the endosperm. Generally, 11S globulins are hexamers composed of identical subunits, each containing two polypeptide chains (Hara et al. 1976, Müntz 1998). The acidic chain, with one presumed intramolecular disulfide bond, is connected to the basic chain by an intermolecular disulfide bond (Staswick et al. 1984, Lawrence et al. 1994) (Fig. 1). The basic chain also contains a free sulfhydryl group. In rice, the proteins corresponding to 11S globulins, the glutelins, are unique in that they exist as large macromolecular complexes formed by disulfide and hydrophobic interactions of acidic and basic polypeptides (Katsube et al. 1999).

<p><strong>Discuss the feasibility and desirability of improving photosynthesis in higher plants through the use of photorespiratory bypasses.</strong></p>
<p>Plants and algae use the Calvin cycle to capture inorganic carbon (as CO<sub>2</sub>) and use ATP and NADPH generated in light reactions to convert it to organic carbon. This process, known as photosynthesis, is the predominant way to replenish organic carbon in the biosphere, and is the basis for human food production. Despite its crucial role, the key enzyme in the pathway that attaches the inorganic CO<sub>2</sub> to the organic sugar 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), called Rubisco, is not efficient, in that it can also use O<sub>2</sub> instead of CO<sub>2</sub> as the substrate, which leads to production of one molecule each of 3-PGA and 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG). Plants use a pathway known as photorespiration to remove the toxic 2-PG and to salvage some (75%) carbon lost from the Calvin cycle by converting two 2-PG to one 3-PGA while releasing CO<sub>2</sub> (Figure <a href="#fig:pr-bypass-native">0.1</a> ). Photorespiration is one of the major factors contributing to inefficiency of photosynthesis because 1) much CO<sub>2</sub> released in mitochondria is escaped into the atmosphere and not re-assimilated in the Calvin cycle, resulting in the reduction of the amount of Calvin cycle intermediates; 2) O<sub>2</sub> directly competes with CO<sub>2</sub> for Rubisco reaction (in ambient atmosphere and at 25<sup>o</sup>C, 25% of the Rubisco reactions in an average C3 plant uses O<sub>2</sub>); 3) in photorespiration, ammonia is released and needs to be reassimilated at the expense of one molecule of ATP and two reducing equivalents (reduced ferredoxins) per molecule of ammonia; 4) reducing power is dissipated in the oxidation of glycolate using molecular oxygen; 5) ATP is also consumed for phosphorylating glycerate in the final step in the photorespiration pathway (because the phosphate group on 2-PG is removed by phosphatase and is thus not conserved). The total direct energy cost for converting two 2PG to one 3PGA is 3.5 ATP and 2 NADPH. The rate of photorespiration is increased by the ratio of O<sub>2</sub> concentration to CO<sub>2</sub> concentration experienced by Rubisco (in C<sub>3</sub> plants, this is similar to atmospheric ratio), and is thus increased by high temperature, as solubulity of CO<sub>2</sub> decreases faster than does O<sub>2</sub> with increasing temperature.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Several groups of photosynthetic organisms independently evolved strategies to minimise photorespiration and are thus able to grow in hot and/or CO<sub>2</sub>-deficient conditions. For example, C<sub>4</sub> and CAM plants uses PEP carboxylase, which uses <span class="math inline">\(HCO_3^-\)</span> instead of CO<sub>2</sub> as the substrate, to perform an initial carboxylation, which results in production of 4-carbon malate/oxaloacetate that is later used to release CO<sub>2</sub> for Rubisco reaction. The initial carboxylation and later decarboxylation is separated spatially in C<sub>4</sub> plants and temporally in CAM plants. In aquatics environments where CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is low, cyanobacteria and green algae uses bicarbonate pumps to actively increase intracellular CO<sub>2</sub> (<span class="math inline">\(HCO_3^-\)</span>) concentration, and their Rubisco is in close proximity with carbonic anhydrase, which converts <span class="math inline">\(HCO_3^-\)</span> to CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The vast majority of land plants (especially crops), however, adopts the C<sub>3</sub> metabolism scheme, which means they do not actively concentrate CO<sub>2</sub> and are susceptible to reduction of photosynthesis efficiency by photorespiration. Thus, it has been believed that reduction in photorespiration can improve photosynthesis and hence crop yield.</p>
<div id="attempts-to-inhibit-photorespiration-and-improve-specificity-of-rubisco" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Attempts to Inhibit Photorespiration and Improve Specificity of Rubisco</h1>
<p>Initial attempts to reduce the effect of photorespiration include inhibition, knock-down and knock-out of the enzymes involved in photorespiration. The relevant genes are identified by screening for mutants that have impaired photorespiratory function. However, most of such mutants exhibited chlorosis and stunted growth. The rationale is simple: reduction of photorespiratory enzyme activity not only does not reduce the production of 2-PG by Rubisco, but also causes the toxic molecules resulted from partial metabolism of 2-PG to accumulate. Also, it has been suggested that photorespiratory enzymes may be also involved in other pathways related to serine biosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism.</p>
<p>Researches that attempted for a Rubisco enzyme with a greater specificity for CO<sub>2</sub> were also conducted. However, it was found that there is a inverse relationship between specificity and rate of reaction. As adaptations to achieve maximal rate of photosynthesis in different environments, Rubisco with high specificity and low turnover rate are typically found in C<sub>3</sub> plants that grow under high temperature/low CO<sub>2</sub>, and Rubisco with high turnover and low specificity are generally found in C<sub>3</sub> plants that grow under lower temperature, as well as in organisms with a CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanism (C<sub>4</sub>/CAM/algae/cyanobacteria).</p>
</div>
<div id="bypassing-photorespiration" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Bypassing Photorespiration</h1>
<p>As attempts to improve Rubisco specificity and inhibit photorespiration directly both did not yield much outcome, photorespiratory bypasses becomes the new hotspot for improving photosynthesis. In general, photorespiratory bypasses are ‘designed photorespiratory pathways’ that aim to minimise energy comsumption and CO<sub>2</sub> loss to the atmosphere. Successful bypasses usually involve confining photorespiration to less compartments (ideally in chloroplast only), preventing lost of reducing power via oxidase, preventing release of NH<sub>3</sub>, and reducing the number of steps of reactions.</p>
<div id="implementing-the-bacterial-glycerate-pathway" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Implementing The Bacterial Glycerate Pathway</h2>
<p>Many bacteria possess a simple and efficient pathway for converting glyoxylate to glycerate. This pathway involves two steps: 1) condensation of two glyoxylate to tartronate semialdehyde (by glyoxylate carboxyligase (GCL)) while releasing CO<sub>2</sub>; 2) reduction of tartronate semialdehyde by tartronate semialdehyde reductase (requiring one NADH) to glycerate. Compared with the native photorespiratory pathway (which converts glyoxylate to glycine in peroxisome and decarboxylates glycine in the mitochondrion), NH<sub>3</sub> release is prevented and, if this pathway can be implemented in the chloroplast, CO<sub>2</sub> release is localised to the chloroplast and is more likely to be re-assimilated by Rubisco instead of escaping to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>To implement the pathway in the chloroplast, a targeting sequence (e.g. Arabidopsis Rubisco small subunit (RbcS) or phosphoglucomutase transit peptide sequence) needs to be added to the N terminus of the gene constructs of the desired enzymes. In addition, the enzyme(s) that converts glycolate to glyoxylate also need(s) to be imported to the chloroplast. In normal plants, this conversion is catalysed by glycolate oxidase in peroxisome, and the same enzyme can be targeted to the chloroplast. However, glycolate oxidase is inefficient, as it uses O<sub>2</sub> as the hydrogen acceptor, which wastes reducing power. In addition, its reaction generates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which needs to be broken down by catalase. A more efficient bacterial enzyme, glycolate dehydrogenase (GDH), can be used to replace glycolate oxidase’s role. GDH uses NAD<sup>+</sup> instead of O<sub>2</sub> as the hydrogen acceptor, which prevents production of toxic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and preserves reducing power.</p>
<p>According to the scheme described above, <span class="citation">Kebeish et al. (2007)</span> generated plants transformed with five chloroplast-targeted bacterial genes encoding glycolate dehydrogenase, glyoxylate carboligase and tartronic semialdehyde reductase (Figure <a href="#fig:pr-bypass-3mech">2.1</a>, 1). In these plants, some glycolate is successfully converted directly to glycerate in chloroplasts, and reduces, but not eliminate, flux of photorespiratory metabolites through peroxisomes and mitochondria. The transgenic plants grew faster, produced more shoot and root biomass, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1299/tables/1">the content of soluble sugars (fructose, glucose and sucrose) increases significantly</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p><span class="citation">Carvalho et al. (n.d.)</span> designed a similar photorespiratory bypass (Figure <a href="#fig:pr-bypass-3mech">2.1</a>, 3). It also uses tartronate semialdehyde (TSA) as the intermediate and thus prevents NH<sub>3</sub> production. However, the CO<sub>2</sub>-releasing TSA synthesis reaction occurs in the peroxisome rather than in the chloroplast and therefore this mechanism does not have the additional benefit of reducing CO<sub>2</sub> loss. In the peroxisome, TSA is converted to hydroxypyruvate by hydroxypyruvate isomerase (HYI), and the rest is identical to the native pathway. Unfortunately, all plants fail to express HYI, and for those with GCL expressed, chlorosis and stunted growth are exhibited, similar to photorespiration mutants. (I think one statement regarding this piece of research at the end of page 808 of the review written by <span class="citation">Weber and Bar-Even (2019)</span> is not appropriate, as HYI was not even expressed)</p>
<p><span class="citation">Maier et al. (2012)</span> used a completely different approach. Instead of taking shortcuts within the native photorespiratory pathway with 3-PGA being the final product, they introduced glycolate oxidase, catalase and malate synthase into the chloroplast, which, together with pyruvate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme which are natively present in the chloroplast, completely oxidise glycolate into two CO<sub>2</sub> (Figure <a href="#fig:pr-bypass-3mech">2.1</a>, 2), while producing NADPH and NADH. Although this pathway requires more energy than the native pathway to restore the ‘<em>status quo ante</em>’ according to the calculation (see <span class="citation">Peterhansel, Blume, and Offermann (n.d.)</span>, Table 2), and is shown in computational modelling to result in a 31% <em>decrease</em> in photosynthetic efficiency compared to WT <span class="citation">(Xin et al. 2015)</span>, experimental studies on <em>Arabidopsiis thaliana</em> surprisingly revealed an increase in biomass in these transgenic plants. A modified version of this approach carried out later on tobacco plants by <span class="citation">South et al. (2019)</span> were shown to be even more successful than Kebeish’s approach which was calculated to be the most energy-efficient. The success of Maier’s method may be explained by thhe fact that, in hot climates (where sunlight is intense), ATP and NADPH supply from light reactions is often not limiting, so an improved energy balance in photorespiration does not necessarily improve the rate of carbon fixation. Instead, the benefit brought about by the rapid CO<sub>2</sub> generation in this bypass is more important. In addition, it is argued that the ‘wasteful’ dissipation of reducing power by glycolate oxidase may actually be beneficial in avoiding production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in high light intensity, when the output of light reactions is in large excess. This also explains why higher plants prefer glycolate oxidase rather than glycolate dehydrogenase.</p>

<p>In the two successful photorespiratory bypasses described above, glycolate metabolism inside chloroplast competes with its export via the glycolate exporter PLGG. Therefore, repression of this transporter is expected to increase the flux into the bypasses and thus further increase the efficiency. <span class="citation">South et al.

The constructs and mechanisms of action are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:pr-bypasses-south-2019">2.2</a>. Both AP1 and AP3 (but not AP2) showed significant increase in dry weight biomass, by 13% and 18%, respectively. When the <em>PLGG1</em> RNAi module is added, the benefit of AP1 is lost, while that of AP3 increases to 24% (<span class="citation">Weber and Bar-Even (2019)</span> implied, on page 808 when citing this work, that inhibition of <em>PLGG</em> always increases efficiency, which is not correct).</p>

<p>Elimination of the AP1 enhancements by the <em>PLGG1</em> RNAi module implies that this introduced pathway ‘may not have had sufficient kinetic capacity to handle the full glycolate flux under high rates of Rubisco oxygenation’, according to <span class="citation">South et al. (2019)</span>. This is in accordance with the aforementioned statement that the efficiency of photorespiratory bypasses in accelerating carbon fixation does not depend on energy economy (conservation of ATP and NADPH), but instead on the rate of conversion of 2-PG into TCA cycle intermediates (CO<sub>2</sub> and/or 3-PGA). That is to say, the real culprit for photorespiration-induced reduction in carbon fixation activity is not loss of energy in the form of ATP and NADPH, but is likely to be the inefficiency of removing 2-PG, as well as the low CO<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> ratio. Thus, in South’s AP3 construct where 2-PG is efficiently cleared up and CO<sub>2</sub> is produced in a large amount, the most prominent increase in carbon fixation and biomass is observed.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>Photorespiration has long been a target for improving photosynthesis and crop yield. Several photorespiratory bypasses, which provide alternative, more efficient pathways to complement or replace the native pathway, have proved successful for this goal in model plants. Much is yet to be known about the mechanisms by which these bypasses accelerates photosynthesis, but recent experiments suggests that, in contrast to the traditional view that photorespiration is energy-wasting and should be avoided, increasing the flux through the photorespiration pathway might instead speed up carbon fixation. Also, conclusion obtained from computational modelling should be viewed with care, at least in photorespiratory studies, as the seemingly sensible assumptions they make often results in significant deviations from the experimental results.</p>

<p><strong>To what extent has genetic manipulation of the Calvin cycle forced the reappraisal of our understanding of the control of metabolic pathways in plants? What do studies of these transgenic plants reveal about the integration of metabolism?</strong></p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Genetic manipulation, particularly graded knock-down of enzymes in the Calvin cycle, has been exploited in the quest for understanding the control of the rate of carbon fixation step of photosynthesis. While initially it was thought that the flux of carbon fixation is limited by a few ‘regulated’ enzymes, with Rubisco being the most promising candidate, many unexpected experimental results revealed that, in reality, the flux of the Calvin cycle is influenced by multifarious factors, some of which are even due to other carbohydrate-unrelated pathways.</p>
<div id="rubisco-does-not-exert-much-control-on-the-flux-of-the-calvin-cycle-unless-in-special-conditions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Rubisco Does not Exert Much Control on the Flux of the Calvin Cycle Unless in Special Conditions</h2>
<p>Rubisco catalyses the carbon fixation step in the Calvin cycle and was initially widely thought to act as a control point on the rate of photosynthesis. Indeed, the enzymatic activity of Rubisco is modulated by a number of ways, such as activation by resersible carbamylation by CO<sub>2</sub> and by Rubisco activase, and inhibition by a number of sugars resulting from Rubisco’s side reactions.</p>
<p><span class="citation">1</span> produced a series of tobacco plants (<em>Nicotiana tabacum</em>) that exhibit a range of reduced amounts of Rubisco by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of plants with antisense mRNA to the gene for the small subunit of Rubisco (<em>rbcS</em>). Such ‘antisense’ plants were used by<span class="citation"><sup>2</sup></span> to examine the control exerted by Rubisco on the rate of photosynthesis. They found that in optimum enviornmental conditions the amount of Rubisco in a leaf could be reduced by more than one-third before any significant effect on the rate of photosynthesis, with <span class="math inline">\(C^J\)</span> = 0.05-0.15 (very small). It was shown that reduction of enzyme amount is compensated for by an increase in Rubisco activation (from about 55% to almost 100%) due to 1) an increase of substrates (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate and CO<sub>2</sub>) and decrease of products (3-phosphoglycerate), and 2) an increase of ATP/ADP ratio in the chloroplast stroma. Also, Rubisco is produced in large excess in WT plants, also explaining the lack of impact of its knock-down.</p>
<p>However, when plants were grown in low light and are then suddenly exposed to high light intensity, there was a near-proportional relation between the amount of Rubisco and the rate of photosynthesis<span class="citation"><sup>3</sup></span>. A similar result can be obtained with low CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. These experiments show that the contribution of Rubisco to the control of photosynthesis depends on both current and past conditions (CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and light intensity).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="other-enzymes-that-catalyse-irreversible-reactions" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Other Enzymes that Catalyse Irreversible Reactions</h1>
<p>Apart from Rubisco, three other enzymes in the Calvin cycle catalyse irreversible reactions: (stromal) fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK). These three enzymes are subjected to a same set of ‘fine’ regulatory mechanisms, all of which are exploited by the light reaction to activate the Calvin cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>pH.</strong> These enzymes have a relatively sharp pH optimium at around 8.2.</li>
<li><strong>Mg<sup>2+</sup></strong> stimulation.</li>
<li><strong>Redox state.</strong> These enzymes are inactive when disulfide bridges form between certain cysteine residues, and are activated by (reduced) thioredoxin, which reduces these disulfide bonds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Analysis of plant strains with each of these three enzymes knocked down reavealed that transformants with decreased SBPase activity show a significant but still non-proportional inhibition of photosynthesis<span class="citation"><sup>4</sup></span> in ambient conditions, while the effects of FBPase and PRK knock-down are marginal. Therefore, enzymes with similar regulatory properties does not indicate they have similar flux-control capabilities in a metabolic pathway.</p>
</div>
<div id="plastid-aldolase-as-an-non-regulated-enzyme-exerts-a-greater-control-than-rubisco-on-the-rate-of-photosynthesis" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Plastid Aldolase as an ‘Non-Regulated’ Enzyme Exerts a Greater Control than Rubisco on the Rate of Photosynthesis</h1>
<p>In the Calvin cycle, aldolase carries out the synthesis of fructose 1,6-bisphohsphate (FBP) and sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphohsphate (SBP), both of which are close to equilibrium. Unlike the four enzymes described previously, aldolase’s activity is devoid of any regulatory properties and thus its rate is solely determined by the concentrations of substrates and products.</p>
<p>However, similar knock-down experiments targeting aldolase showed unexpected results, in that reduction in aldolase was found to significantly reduce the rate of photosynthesis<span class="citation"><sup>5</sup></span>. A 30% decrease of aldolase activity in potato transformants led to a small (5–10%) inhibition of ambient photosynthesis, and reduction below 30% of the wild-type activity led to a severe inhibition. The experiment is repeated with different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, and it was found that the inhibition is smallest in low light and highest in high light and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (with <span class="math inline">\(C^J\)</span> of about 0.18 and 0.56, respectively).</p>
<p>Decreased expression of aldolase inhibits photosynthesis for different reasons in low and high light. In low light, decreased expression of aldolase led to an accumulation of its substrate, triose phosphates and a depletion of of its product, which in turn causes the depletion of RuBP. In high light (plus elevated CO<sub>2</sub>), however, the triose phosphates remained very low, RuBP remained high, and PGA was higher in the transformants than in wild-type plants. This is because high irradiation inhibits starch synthesis and hence accumulation of phosphorylated intermediates, which leads to P<sub>i</sub>-limitation, which in turn restricts ATP regeneration by the light reaction. The decreased ATP concentration thhen limits conversion of 3PGA to GAP, causing 3PGA to accumulate, which in turn results in product inibition of Rubisco. Of course, the two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and the relative importance of each vary gradually according to the light intensity.</p>
<p>It is important to note here that, to fully rationalise the difference in the effectiveness of inhibition of the Calvin cycle in different conditions, the effect of the conditions on other pathways (starch synthesis) in the metabolic network need also be considered.</p>
</div>
<div id="transketolase-directly-controls-not-only-calvin-cycle-but-also-other-pathways" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Transketolase Directly Controls not Only Calvin Cycle but Also Other Pathways</h1>
<p>Perturbation of the enzymes involved in the central carbohydrate metabolism pathways can directly influence the activity of other pathways. Transketolase is such an example.</p>
<p>In the Calvin cycle, transketolase catalyses the reactions 1) <span class="math inline">\(F6P + GAP \rightarrow E4P + X5P\)</span> and 2) <span class="math inline">\(S7P + GAP \rightarrow X5P + R5P\)</span>, both of which are reactions close to equilibrium. Tobacco tranformant with decreased expression of plastid transketolase were also produced. Like aldolase, this ‘non-regulated’ enzyme also has a relatively high flux-control coefficient, especially in saturating light and CO<sub>2</sub>. As expected, loss of transketolase activity results in an increase in the amounts of its substrate (F6P) and decrease of its products, ultimately leading to a decrease of RuBP concentration. However, it was also observed that there was a significant decrease in the levels of aromatic amino acids, intermediates of the phenylpropanoid pathway, and secondary products such as chlorogenic acid and lignin. A plausible explanation for these observations is that the flux into the shikimic acid pathway (which synthesises aromatic pathways) is limited by the decreasing erythrose 4-phosphate (one product of transketolase) concentration.</p>
<p>The multiple consequences of reducing transketolase activity highlight the extent of integration within thhe central metabolic pathways and the potential difficulties in attepting to modify flux through a specific section of the metabolic network.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>Genetic manipulation (mainly knock-outs) of some enzymes of the Calvin cycle qualitatively revealed some of the logic behind the regulation of (plant) metabolism in general: 1) loss of regulated enzymes such as Rubisco are compensated by increase in activity, 2) regulated enzymes are often produced in excess so that minor reduction in their amount does not affect the flux at all, 3) non-regulated enzymes such as aldolase are not produced in excess, and their loss restricts the flux more effectively, 4) the extent and the mechanisms of influence on Calvin cycle flux by reduction of an enzyme is affected by enviornmental conditions and the developmental history of the plant, 5) perturbation of a single reaction/enzyme can influence other, even distantly-related metabolic pathways, due to the plethora of interconnected components, 6) the flux through the Calvin cycle is determined by multiple enzymes.</p>
<p>Lots of effort has been made in modelling plant metabolism pathways such as the Calvin cycle (in order to ‘improve’ them), which proves extremely difficult. The Calvin cycle does not exist in isolation, so natually its flux is also influenced by other pathways in the complicated plant metabolism network, through shared intermediates/enzymes/regulatory molcules. Therefore, the precise prediction of its activity, in principle, also requires modelling of other, even distantly related pathways. However, it is impossible to presisely predict the behaviour of the entire metabolic network without knowing all the details (kinetic properties under different conditions, concentrations of enzymes and substrates, etc.) of every reaction in the network. Even if precise kinetic data of enzymes and concentrations of all substances can be obtained, further challenges will be encountered when considering <em>in vivo</em> modelling: unlike the test tube where all substances are relatively evenly distributed and there is only one single isolated compartment, the plant cells are extensively compartmentalised (many metabolic pathways take place in more than one compartments), and substances (substrate or enzymes) may not be evenly distributed and instead localise to specific regions of each compartment, thus altering the effective concentration. In addition, the effects of the internal and external enviornment (e.g. signalling molecules, light intensity) on gene expression of enzymes are also difficult to simulate.</p>

<p><strong>Why do plants co-ordinate the relative activities of Photosystems I and II and how is this co-ordination achieved?</strong></p>
<div id="background" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Background</h1>
<p>Photosystems I and II are photochemical complexes that harvest light energy to drive endergonic redox reactions. Their operation in series (PS-II then PS-II), known as the Z scheme, results in generation of oxygen from water via photolysis, ATP production via electron transport chain (ETC) and production of NADPH (reduction of NADP<sup>+</sup>), which is essential for providing reducing power in anabolic reactions such as photosynthesis, by ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup> reductase. PS-I can also operate alone, resulting in cyclic photophosphorylation, generating ATP only.</p>
<p>Each photosystem exists on the thylakiod membrane (PS-II mainly in grana lamellae; PS-I mainly in stroma lamellae) as a multisubunit pigment-protein complex (or a dimer thereof, in the case of PS-II) comprising a reaction centre (RC) core containing a pair of chlorophyll <em>a</em> molecules, which is surrounded by other accessory proteins as well as variable number of antenna complexes ((trimers of) LHC-II/LHC-I; also known as chlorophyll <em>a/b</em> light-harvesting complex ) containing accessory pigments (e.g. chlorophylls and carotenoids) that pass light energy to the reaction centre via resonance energy transfer. The reaction centre in PS-II preferentially absorbs red light at wavelength 680 nm and is thus referred to as P680; the reaction centre in PS-I, known as P700, preferentially absorbs far-red light.</p>
<p>The activities of two types of photosystems is determined both by the external factors, i.e. intensity and wavelength of light, as well as the the intrinsic factors which can be regulated by the plant cells, namely the number of PS-II/PS-I cores and the antenna complexes (and hence the amount of accessory pigments) associated with them. Such regulation can affect the absolute activities of PS-II and PS-I as well as their activities relative to each other.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-is-coordination-between-photosystems-i-and-ii-needed" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Why is Coordination between Photosystems I and II Needed</h1>
<p>Because the PS-I and PS-II complexes are not physically coupled (so their abundance can differ) and their light absorption properties differ (PS-I prefers longer wavelength), their activities are not directly related and are often different. The activities of the two photosystems relative to each other can be regulated using the mechanisms described in Section <a href="#achieve">3</a>, but before that, the benefits of this regulation are considered here:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Stoichiometry adjustment.</strong> PS-II and PS-I activities should ideally be equal, in order to maximise the efficiency of light utilisation for production of NADPH in vectorised electron flow, which would otherwise be limited by the slower photosystem. There is a need for this kind of adjustment when there is a change in light quality. Upon illumination by far-red light that preferentially activates PS-I (PS-I light), PS-I activity is greater than PS-II, so PS-II activity shhould be improved relative to PS-I. Conversely, illumination by PS-II light leads to hyperactive PS-II, and its activity should be reduced relative to PS-II. These two states are referred to state 1 and 2, respectively, and state transition is the process by which the plant adjusts relative activity of PS-II and PS-I in response to a change in state.</li>
<li><strong>Protection against photoinhibition.</strong> If PS-II activity exceeds PS-I activity, the rate of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is increased. However, recent studies on stn7 mutants argue against this role. Photodamage of PS-II is unavoidable even under nomal conditions, and it is repaired efficiently in healthy plants.</li>
<li><strong>Meeting increased requirement for ATP.</strong> If PS-I activity exceeds PS-II activity, the excess activity in PS-I results in cyclic electron flow (CEF), generating additional ATP. Theoretically, this may be exploited by the plant to meet increased demand for ATP. However, recent work revealed that CEF is controlled by the redox power and is independent of state transition: state 2 is neither sufficient nor required to promote CEF <span class="citation">(Takahashi et al. 2013)</span>.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> The Role of the Plastoquinone Pool</h2>
<p>The oxidative status of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool reflects the relative activity of PS-II and PS-I, and is involved in the signalling pathway of both short-term and long-term coordination (described in Section <a href="#redistribution">3.2</a> and <a href="#transcriptional">3.3</a>, respectively).</p>
<p>Upon illumination by PS-I light (in state 1), PS-I activity is greater than PS-II, leading to oxidation of the plastoquinone pool (most plastoquinone molecules are in the oxidised form, PQ). Conversely, the plastoquinone pool becomes reduced upon preferential excitation of PS-II (Figure <a href="#fig:plastoquinone">3.1</a>).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Reversible Redistribution of LHC-II</h2>
<p>LHC-II plays an important role in the coordination between PS-I and PS-II. The structure of one LHC-II protein has been determined by a combination of electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography (reviewed by <span class="citation">Barros and Kühlbrandt (2009)</span>). It contains three membrane-spaning <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-helices, and binds about 15 chlorophyll <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> molecules plus a few carotenoids. LHC-II complexes of different subtypes (of which Lhcb1, 2 and 3 are the most common) spontaneously assemble into trimers (can be heterogeneous), which then associate with PS-II and PS-I to increase the efficiency of their corresponding photochemical reaction.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The LHC-II subtypes Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 (but not Lhcb3) can be phosphorylated by a specific protein kinase called STN7 (a.k.a. Stt7) at a threonine residue near the N-terminus <span class="citation">(Mullet 1983)</span>. This happens during transition to state 2, when the STN7 kinase, which is associated with a specific region of the Rieske protein of the cytochrome <em>b<sub>6</sub>f</em> complex (Cyt<em>b<sub>6</sub>f</em>), is activated upon binding of PQH<sub>2</sub> to the Q<sub>o</sub> site of Cyt<em>b<sub>6</sub>f</em>. Phosphorylation on LHC-II causes a conformational change (Figure <a href="#fig:lhcii-conf-change">3.2</a>), reduces its affinity to PS-II and increases its affinity to PS-I. The increase in affinity to PS-I is due to not only the conformational change, but also the tight association between the phosphate group and a specific arginine residue in PsaL, a protein that facilitates docking of LHC-II to PS-I core complex. As a result, LHC-II migrates from PS-II towards PS-I, thus enhancing efficiency of PS-I relative to PS-II (Figure <a href="#fig:stn7-tap38-pq-lhcii">3.3</a>). This is supported by the findings that plants without either STN7 <span class="citation">(Bellafiore et al. 2005)</span> or Lhcb1+Lhcb2 <span class="citation">(Andersson et al. 2003)</span> do not undergo state transitions. It was later shown by <span class="citation">Longoni et al. (2015)</span> that only Lhcb2 phosphorylation is relevant to state transition (Lhcb1 phosphorylation causes its exclusion from the complex). The N-terminal region of phosphorylated Lhcb2 interacts with PsaL, PsaH and PsaO proteins, and PsaO bridges PsaA (PSI reaction centre) and Lhcb2 through contacts within the membrane and on the stromal and luminal surface. PsaO is associated with two chlorophyll molecules which facilitates resonance energy transfer from LHC-II to PsaA.</p>
<p>The phosphorylation can be reversed by a specific kinase called TAP38 (a.k.a PPH1). When PS-I is over-excited relative to PS-II, STN7 is inactive, and TAP38 dephosphorylates LHC-II and causes them to return to PS-II (Figure <a href="#fig:stn7-tap38-pq-lhcii">3.3</a>).</p>

<div id="transcriptional" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Transcriptional Regulation</h2>
<p>Regulation of relative activity of PS-I and PS-II can also be achieved by controlling the amount of transcription of PS-I genes (e.g. <em>psaA</em>) and PS-II genes (<em>psbA</em>).</p>
<p><span class="citation">Puthiyaveetil et al. (2008)</span> described a sensor kinase called chloroplast sensor kinase (CSK) that couples oxidation state of PQ to transcriptional control of psbA. As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:csk">3.4</a>, PS-I light causes the PQ pool to be oxidised, and then CSK, which is activated by PQ (the PQ analogue, DBMIB (2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-5-isopropyl-<em>p</em>-benzoquinone) binds to CSK similarly), autophosphorylates itself, and then phosphorylates sigma factor 1 (SIG1) subunit of PEP (RNA polymerase). This results in specific repression of PS-I genes (<em>psaA</em>), thus decreasing the stoichiometry of PS-I to PS-I. Conversely, CSK is inactive with a reduced PQ pool under PS-II light, and SIG1 phosphatase removes the repression of PS-I gene transcription, thus increasing the stoichiometry of PS-I to PS-II.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> How does SIG1 phosphorylation confer phhotosystem promoter specificity?</h3>
<p>Bacterial sigma factors contain the region 1.1 at the extreme N-terminus. Region 1.1 is a poorly-conserved, acidic region, which is associated with the positively charged catalytic cavity of RNA polymerase in the closed (non-transcribing) conformation. To begin transcription, (negatively-charged) DNA must replace region 1.1, and the efficiency of this replacement depends on how well the -10 and -35 elements of the promoter match the consensus sequence.</p>
<p>Chloroplast SIG1 also has an N-terminal un-conserved region (UCR), but it contains both acidic and basic patches. It is proposed that, in PS-II light, the basic patch and the acidic patch of the un-phosphorylated SIG1 form a complex through electrostatic interactions, thus preventing the association of the acidic patch with the basic catalytic cavity.
In PS-I light, phosphorylation with the basic patch disfavours its complex formation with the acidic patches, thus allowing the acidic patch to associate with the catalytic cavity, where it acts as the gatekeeper and discriminates between strong and weak promoters.</p>
<p>By comparing the -35 and -10 regions of the promoters of <em>psaA</em> and <em>psbA</em> to the consensus sequence, it can be deduced that <em>psbA</em> (PS-II gene) has a stronger promoter and is therefore preferentially transcribed over PS-I under PS-I light, when SIG1 is phosphorylated and the discrimination mechanism is functioning.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>Plants need to coordinate the efficiency of PS-II and PS-I in order to maximise the utilisation of light energy in linear electron flow. Upon change in light quality, activities of PS-II and PS-I are transiently unsyncronised, leading to change in oxidative state of PQ (i.e. accumulation of PQ or PQH<sub>2</sub>). This triggers two mechanisms used to regain the balance. First, PQH<sub>2</sub> binding to Cyt<em>b<sub>6</sub>f</em> activates STN7, which in turn causes phosphorylation of LHC-II and its migration from PS-II to PS-I. Second, PQ activates CSK, which phosphorylates SIG1, causing PS-II genes to be preferentially transcribed.</p>
