I read a lot of textbooks. Back in high school, I read *Campbell Biology*[^Reece], *Life*[^Sadava], and *Biology*[^Solomon] to prepare for Biology Olympiad. Now I'm reading Stryer's[^Stryer] and Voet's[^Voet] *Biochemistry*, and *Lehninger's Principles of Biochemistry*.[^Leh]

Different authors have different perspectives on the same subject or single topic, so reading different textbooks helps to gain a holistic understanding of that topic or subject. However, for all 'Biology' books, or 'Biochemistry' books, most contents are essentially written in the same way by different authorsâ€”rephrased in one way or another. 

This means when I want to extract valueable information 
embedded within a large amount of 'repetitive information'

Why don't these authors come together and write a 



Wikipedia is a huge lead towards 'free knowledge for all', but it has critical constraints that make it unsuitable for 'education'. Can you learn biochemistry with wikipedia only? No, you need a textbook and/or series of lectures. Why? What's the difference between Wikipedia and textbooks?
