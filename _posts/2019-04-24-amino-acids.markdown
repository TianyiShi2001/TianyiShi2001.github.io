#Learn Biochemical Principles by Amino Acids

## Polar Non-charged Amino Acids

### Asparagine (Asn, N)
- Two strategically placed Asn in the center of the aquaporin tether the central water molecule such that its both lone pairs are occupied. This stops proton transfer by electron movement. 

### Glutamine (Gln, Q)
- In metabolism
	- Mainly produced by the muscle (glutamine synthetase) and consumed by the intestine (glutaminase).
	- Also consumed by the kidney for urea production (and gluconeogenesis).
