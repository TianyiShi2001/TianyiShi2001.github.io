#Learn Biochemical Principles by Amino Acids

## Polar Non-charged Amino Acids

### Asparagine (Asn, N)
- Two strategically placed Asn in the center of the aquaporin tether the central water molecule such that its both lone pairs are occupied. This stops proton transfer by electron movement. 
- The only amino acid to which N-linked oligosaccharides are attached (O-linked ones attach to S or T)

### Glutamine (Gln, Q)
- In metabolism
	- Mainly produced by the muscle (glutamine synthetase) and consumed by the intestine (glutaminase).
	- Also consumed by the kidney for urea production (and gluconeogenesis).

### Serine (Ser, S) and Threonine (Thr, T)
- O-linked oligosaccharides attach to either S or T
- Receptor serine/threonine protein kinase
- Common phosphorylation target by protein kinases
