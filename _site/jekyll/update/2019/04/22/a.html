    <p>Everyone knows ACh stimulates skeletal muscle to contract. You might also remember that striated muscle (including skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle) contraction is initiated by a wave of depolarisation, followed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> release—troponin—tropomyosin displacement—exposure of myosin head binding site. However, the interaction between ACh and muscle contraction is much more than this.</p>

<p>ACh reduces heart rate, causes bronchioles to constrict (bronchoconstriction) and blood vessles to dialate (vasodilation), using 3 different mechanisms (4, if counting skeletal muscle contraction).</p>

<p>So, <em>why</em>?</p>

<p>Neurobiologists classify neurotransmitter receptors into <q>ionotropic receptors</q> and <q>metabotropic receptors</q>. Iootropic receptors are ion channels; ligand (neurotransmitter) binding causes the ion channel to open, allowing passage of specific ions to passively diffuse across the plasma membrane (down their electrochemical gradient). Metabotropic receptors act indirectly on ion channels through intracellualr signalling pathways to produce versatile effects. Most metabotropic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors.</p>

<p>ACh is secreted from the terminal bouton of lower motor neurons into the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), causing the innervated muscle fibres to contract. Skeletal muscles have ionotropic ACh receptors known as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which is named after their agonist, nicotine. ACh diffuse across the NMJ and bind to ionotropic receptors, thus opening these cation channels. Although these channels have a loose specificity—Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> can all pass through—Na<sup>+</sup> influx predominates, causing depolarisation (this can be explained by electrochemical driving force or the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz (GHK) voltage equation).</p>

<p>ACh is also secreted by the postgangionic nerves of the parasympathetic nervous system to coordinate the <q>rest and digest</q> responses. The ACh receptors responsible for these effects are metabotropic, and they are called muscarinic ACh receptors, or mAChR (also named after their agonist, muscarine). These receptors are all G protein-coupled receptors and are all sensitive to muscarine, but they are classified into 5 types (M<sub>1</sub> to M<sub>5</sub>) according to their functional differences.</p>

<p>How can similar (sometimes identical) receptors with the same extracelluar ligand exert different effects? Apparently it’s due to the variation in the indentity and/or the expression level of the proteins involved in downstream signalling pathways. It can be done in several ways. I shall describe them in a separate article and make a hyperlink here.</p>

<p>Cardiac muscle expresses M<sub>2</sub> receptors, which are coupled with the G protein G<sub>i</sub>. This class of G protein has two main effects upon activation: its α subunit <em>inhibits</em> adenylyl cyclase and its βγ subunit opens K<sup>+</sup> channels. It is the increased conductance of K<sup>+</sup> that makes depolarisation of the membrane and subsequent muscle contraction more difficult.</p>

<p>Bronchiole smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells express M<sub>3</sub> receptors, which are associated with G<sub>q</sub>. Upon activation, its α subunit activates phospholipase C-β (PLC-β). PLC produces IP<sub>3</sub>, which causes Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER. Ca<sup>2+</sup> then stimulates smooth muscle to contract, using a mechanism different from that of skeletal muscle contraction. (calmodulin—MLCK—myosin light chain phosphorylation) <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/General_reaction_catalyzed_by_phospholipase_C.tiff" alt="PLC activity" /></p>

<p>Many vascular endothelial cells also express M<sub>3</sub> receptors and ACh binding lead to elevated intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. This time, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates an enzyme called endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which is mediated by calmodulin and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). eNOS synthesises NO, which is a small hydrophobic molecule able to diffuse across membranes and enter surrounding smooth muscle cells. There, in the cytoplasm, it activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), which produces cGMP. cGMP then activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase, which in turn lowers intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] by several mechanisms. <img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/04/24/5cbf651da9dd8.png" alt="Effects of PKG" /></p>
